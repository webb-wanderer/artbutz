The remark should not be misinterpreted as a claim that the number of Jews who perished was some minority of 350,000. Many more died outside of the concentration camps, from diseases in ghettos, in occasional pogroms, and in other commonplace and uncommonplace ways. The number is not known. </td>

					<td> Laqueur, Appendix 1. The cases of the politician-journalist Lemmer and the economist Sommer, who are said to have passed information about exterminations to Swiss contacts, are of dubious import. Lemmer was not associated with the <i>Abwehr</i> and, as Laqueur notes, there is nothing is his autobiography about passing on information about extermination. Sommer was an army liaison officer between the General Staff and the Abwehr, and also travelled to Switzerland in connection with trade relations. One can infer from M. Gilbert, 56ff, that Sommer&rsquo;s association with a summer 1942 report that <q>camps are being prepared where all the Jews of Europe and a great part of the Russian prisoners-of-war will be exterminated by gas</q> has been claimed not by Sommer, who died in 1965, but by two Jewish intermediaries. It is also worth noting that neither Lemmer nor Sommer appear to have been seriously involved with the anti-Hitler opposition; both survived the war. </td>

					<td> Pressac (1989), 108, cites a letter from Topf (reproduced in Schnabel, 346). This letter asserts that one of the firm&rsquo;s double muffle ovens can reduce <q>in about 10 hours 10&ndash;35 corpses</q> (that is, the average time claimed to reduce one corpse in a muffle ranged from 34 minutes to two hours), and can be operated day and night, an assertion not borne out by later experience at Auschwitz, as Pressac notes (227&ndash;247, esp. 244). I believe this document is authentic, and the exaggerations are the usual ones of people trying to sell something. I note that it clearly specifies that corpses are supplied to the oven serially (<q><i>hintereinander</i></q>), in contradiction to the usual <q>witness</q> who claims that three or even more were fed into a muffle together. Witnesses also assert that the crematories belched flames from the chimneys, certainly not the operational mode of modern crematories. Pressac accepts such tall tales without protest (251, 253). I have far more trouble with the document reproduced by Pressac on p. 247, ostensibly a letter of June 28, 1943, from the Auschwitz construction department claiming that the 52 muffles at Auschwitz could reduce 4,756 corpses in 24 hours of operation. That works out to an average of 16 minutes per corpse. The date of the document was when the breakdowns of the crematories and consequent attempts at emergency repairs gave the SS no reason to exaggerate the efficacy of Topf&rsquo;s products (for example, Pressac (1989), 100, 227, 236). Moreover according to another document reproduced by Pressac (224), the crematories operated only 12 hours per day. On p. 91, Pressac gives the provenance of the June 28, 1943, document as the <q>Committee of Anti-Fascist Resistants of the German Democratic Republic.</q> I am in the position of a man staring at an authentic-looking German document that states that a Volkswagen broke the sound barrier. If it is not a forgery, then it must have been some sort of joke. In one of his neo-Pythagorean exegeses that Faurisson has noted (1991b, 145&ndash;149), Pressac says (110, 244) that such figures should be divided <q>by a factor of 2 to 5.</q> </td>

I have not used Mauthausen in this comparison because, although the recorded deaths are fairly well known (see, for example, Mars&aacute;lek), the extent of cremation means is uncertain. Mauthausen was more decentralized than the other camps; for example, the satellite camp Gusen experienced about as many deaths as the main camp, and it and other satellite camps had their own crematoria of uncertain extent (see Pressac (1989), 108&ndash;114, and, Mars&aacute;lek, 157). In addition, Mauthausen on occasion used ordinary municipal crematoria, such as the one in Steyr. </td>

The other testimonies &mdash; in Bezwinska &amp; Czech, 114ff., 174ff., and in M&uuml;ller, 31&ndash;49 &mdash; also claim not merely gassings, but mass gassings of Jews in the mortuary of Crematorium I during much of 1942. One of the many contradictions in Pressac&rsquo;s work is that on p. 133 he also asserts, on the basis of logic that I can&rsquo;t see at all, that from the data given in the Leuchter report we can infer <q>use as a homicidal gas chamber</q> for Crematorium I. Another contradiction I noticed is that on p. 106 he contrasts the oil-fired ovens of Buchenwald with the coke-fired ovens of Auschwitz, but on p. 259 he says they were <q>identical.</q> Faurisson reviews additional contradictions (1991a &amp; b). </td>

I do not think the question is important, because there is no reason to assume that J&auml;hrling (a heating technician employed by the SS) and Messing (a fitter employed by the Topf company that was providing the crematorium ovens) cared very much about the special terminology of morgues.
