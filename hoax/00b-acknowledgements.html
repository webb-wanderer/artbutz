			Acknowledgments
		</h2>
		<p>
			A number of individuals contributed valuable suggestions and critiques which are reflected in the text of this book, but of course the responsibility for any errors of fact or interpretation, if such be found, is entirely my own. I also wish to reserve for myself any problems that may arise on account of the reaction to this book, and for this reason I refrain from making the applicable personal acknowledgments here.
		</p>
		<p>
			Institutional acknowledgments are made to the U.S. National Archives, the U.S. Army Audio-visual Agency, and the Foreign Affairs Document and Reference Center of the U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC, to the Panstwowe Museum, O&#347;wi&#281;cim, and to the Library of the University of Chicago, and the Center for Research Libraries, Chicago.
		</p>
		<p>
			Special acknowledgment is made to the staffs of the Imperial War Museum, London, the national office of the Netherlands Red Cross, The Hague, and the Library of Northwestern University (especially the inter-library loan department), Evanston, all of whom contributed more than routine services without, of course, being aware of the exact nature of the research involved.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the 2003 (English) and 2015 editions (English and German), I also wish to acknowledge the editorial work of Germar Rudolf. I could not have had a better editor.
		</p>
		<p>
			Arthur R. Butz
