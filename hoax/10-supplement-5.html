			Supplement 5: Vergasungskeller
		</h2>
		<p>
			[<b>Webmaster note:</b> Formerly Appendix F]
		</p>
		<p>
			Veteran revisionists recognize that an outstanding small problem has been the &quot;Vergasungskeller&quot; that was evidently in or near Crematorium II at Auschwitz.
		</p>
		<p>
			Crematorium II (and its mirror image Crematorium III) had two huge underground morgues, Leichenkeller 1 (LK 1) and LK 2, and a smaller morgue LK 3. LK 1 and LK 2 were simple concrete morgues in which bodies were simply laid on the floor. A letter from the Auschwitz construction department dated 29 January 1943, when the construction of Crematorium II was nearing completion, reports that frost prohibits removal of the formwork for the ceiling of the &quot;Leichenkeller&quot; (without specifying which of the three is meant) but that this is unimportant, since the &quot;Vergasungskeller&quot; can be used for that purpose, i.e. as a morgue. The document had the number NO-4473 at the Nuremberg trials.
		</p>
		<p>
			When NO-4473 is interpreted with the help of some documents reproduced by Pressac [1], it is shown that the &quot;Leichenkeller&quot; is LK 2. Pressac believes that the Vergasungskeller is LK 1 and that a &quot;slip&quot;, indeed &quot;enormous gaff&quot; (sic), caused the author of the document to betray the true purpose of LK 1, referring to it as a &quot;gassing cellar&quot; (although the usual German word for such a concept is &quot;Gaskammer&quot;). On no known set of engineering drawings is a &quot;Vergasungskeller&quot; indicated [2].
		</p>
		<p>
			Many of those who would have us believe that there were homicidal gas chambers at Auschwitz insist on this interpretation.
		</p>
		<p>
			In my 1976 book The Hoax of the Twentieth Century I offered that this was a part of the crematorium building devoted to generating a combustible gas for the ovens [3]. This interpretation was linguistically correct and could be technically correct, depending on the design of the ovens. The primary meaning of &quot;Vergasung&quot; is gas generation or carburetion, i.e. turning something into a gas. A secondary meaning is application of a gas as in fumigation or in gas warfare. It is also the word Germans use to refer to the alleged gassing of Jews; however, they use &quot;Gaskammer&quot; rather than &quot;Vergasungskammer&quot; or &quot;Vergasungskeller&quot; for the facility imagined to have accomplished this. Such usage also applies in the literature on fumigation [4].
		</p>
		<p>
			By 1989 Robert Faurisson realized that my original interpretation was wrong and later in 1989 Pressac [5] conclusively showed that it was wrong, based on the design of the cremation ovens. In 1991 Faurisson offered a theory [6] that the Vergasungskeller was a storage area, for fumigation supplies, within LK 3.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1992 I showed that there were many ways &quot;Vergasung&quot; can come up in sewage treatment technology, and offered that the Vergasungskeller might be found in the sewage treatment plant next to the crematorium. However I favored the interpretation that the Vergasungskeller was simply a facility for generating fuel gas for the camp [7]. NO-4473 suggests, but does not require, that the Vergasungskeller was located within the crematorium building.
		</p>
		<p>
			The purpose of this note is to offer another interpretation which I now believe is more plausible than any earlier offered by me or anybody else. Before I do that I should remark that the problem here is what the Vergasungskeller was, not whether it was a homicidal gas chamber. Those who claim it was a homicidal gas chamber focus their attention entirely on that one word in the document. If they would instead focus on what the document says, they would realize that it is impossible to make that interpretation work. The document shows that in January 1943 the Germans were in a great rush to use the building as an ordinary crematorium.
		</p>
		<p>
			As Faurisson discussed earlier [8], during World War II the combatants paid great heed that new structures be considered, if possible, as air raid shelters. There were two principal dangers that such shelters were to provide protection against: bombs and gas attacks. On account of World War I experiences, the possibilities of the latter were taken very seriously. Indeed many simply assumed that gas would be used, despite treaties outlawing its use. Typically, a gas shelter was conceived of as a bomb shelter, preferably underground and very strong structurally, with some features added to make it secure against gas; a gas shelter had to be gas tight but allow people to breathe [9]. Since in many cases it was not economic to provide such structures for at most only occasional use, it was recognized that such shelters could exist in the form of embellishments to structures that exist for other purposes. However the number of suitable such structures was limited. For example, the typical underground cellar belongs to a building with several stories; the collapse of these in an air raid could prevent people from leaving the cellar.
		</p>
		<p>
			My hypothesis is that the Vergasungskeller was a gas shelter. It need not have been located within Crematorium II but I believe it most likely was, on account of the fact that Crematoria II and III, with their large concrete cellars, were obviously ideal for adaptation as air raid shelters. Indeed when this problem is looked at from the point of view of defense against air raids it seems there was no better choice at Auschwitz. The German authorities responsible for providing air raid shelters would have insisted that the necessary embellishments be made to these structures. My reading of some of the relevant chemical warfare literature convinces me that Crematoria II and III were conceived of by the Germans as having this additional role.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have never seen the word &quot;Vergasungskeller&quot; in a lexicon; indeed I have seen it only in discussions of NO-4473! However I have seen a German-Russian military dictionary that says &quot;Gaskeller&quot; means the same thing as &quot;Gasschutzraum&quot; (gas shelter) [10]. However we should not consider ourselves bound to dictionaries on this. If one asks the question, &quot;In a World War II military context, what might &quot;Vergasungskeller&quot; and/or &quot;Gaskeller&quot; mean?&quot;, I think that &quot;gas shelter&quot; is the answer that comes naturally to mind, and that other meanings are somewhat strained.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a personal example, I can report that I have been unable to find the term &quot;control lab&quot; (or &quot;control laboratory&quot;, &quot;controls lab&quot;, &quot;controls laboratory&quot;) in my IEEE Standard Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms (edition of 1972), although every university Dept. of Electrical Engineering in the USA has a &quot;control lab&quot; and that is how we normally refer to such a place. I have also been unable to find the term in an unabridged Webster's, in an on-line version of the Oxford English Dictionary, and in several other dictionaries I have.
		</p>
		<p>
			If this theory is correct then we should view all three cellars in Crematorium II as air raid shelters, with only one being provided with the additional measures to make it effective as a gas shelter. That could only be LK 1, since NO-4473 implies it is not LK 2, LK 3 was very small and, conclusively, because LK 1 was the only one of the three provided with a gas-tight door [11]. Moreover while all parts of the building had motor driven air extraction systems, it appears that only LK 1 had a motor driven air intake system [12].
		</p>
		<p>
			Pressac also believes the Vergasungskeller was LK 1; under my hypothesis he is then right on location but wrong on function. LK 1 had the basic features of a gas shelter. Pressac admits that the air exhaust (at the bottom) and air intake (near the top) systems of LK 1 were misplaced for a gas chamber employing HCN [13]. Although HCN is only slightly lighter than air, there are various practical reasons why gas chambers employing it normally expel the gas from the top when the gassing process is completed [14]. Carbon dioxide, by contrast, is much heavier than air and is most naturally expelled from the bottom of the relevant space.
		</p>
		<p>
			Why would the author of NO-4473 not refer to a Leichenkeller as a Leichenkeller? I don't think a slip is involved. We normally do not consider ourselves bound to use only formal designations. More commonly, we refer to things according to their function or in any case the function that happens to be in mind at the time. The gas shelter features of LK 1 were its principal structural distinction from LK 2 and those features were being taken into account in the construction at the time. It was natural that LK 1 might be referred to as the gas shelter.
		</p>
		<p>
			As another example of a use of terminology suggested by function, the engineer Messing referred to LK 2 of Crematorium II, during construction, as an &quot;Auskleidekeller&quot; (undressing cellar), another one of what Pressac considers &quot;slips&quot; [15]. This has been another point raised by those who would put a homicidal interpretation on Crematorium II; the victims would according to this theory undress themselves in LK 2 and then be gassed in LK 1.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is much more prosaic. Pressac believes that, when the Germans viewed Crematorium II as an ordinary crematorium, then the sequence of processing bodies was originally contemplated to be LK 3 to LK 2 to LK 1, but that LK 3 was eventually eliminated from the regular sequence [16]. However that may be, if the dead bodies were contemplated to start in LK 2 they would then be undressed there. They would be stored in LK 1 while awaiting cremation. Presumably LK 3 was only used when a body needed some sort of special processing, e.g. dissection or the famous extraction of gold fillings from teeth.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am struck by the humorous simplicity of the theory offered here.

The reader should understand that the title of this book is misleading, as the only real &quot;gas chambers&quot; whose &quot;technique and operation&quot; are discussed are fumigation gas chambers. The homicidal gas chambers are only imagined, based on alleged &quot;criminal traces&quot;, two of which are dealt with here. It is common to refer to this book in discussion of Auschwitz because it is the greatest single published source of reproductions of original documents and photographs for the camp. </li>
