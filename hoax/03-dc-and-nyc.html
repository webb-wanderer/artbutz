		<h3>
			The Rubber Crisis of 1942
		</h3>
		<p>
			The military situation of the Allied powers in 1942 was superficially a desperate one. After the winter of 1941-1942 the German armies continued their advance across Russia. The destruction of most of the American Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 had made the Pacific a virtual Japanese lake. America was suddenly faced with a problem which was, for her, a strange one: lack of a crucial raw material without which no war effort appeared possible. Japan controlled what had been the source of ninety per cent of America's rubber, Malaya and the East Indies, and the source of the other ten per cent, Central and South America, was hopelessly inadequate.<a class="footnote">96</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			The manner in which America extricated herself from this grave situation will go down as one of the great ironies of history. America, one would expect, could not resolve this problem since nobody in America had thought in terms of &quot;autarky.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			Standard Oil of New Jersey had the essentials of the I.G. Farben Buna rubber process. This was on account of a series of agreements between the two companies, commencing in 1927, covering technical cooperation and mutual licensing arrangements. Standard was quite interested in Buna rubber since it could also be made (more easily) from oil. The cooperation continued, with the consent of the German Government, right up to the outbreak of war and even, to some extent, after the outbreak of war. The American side benefited hugely from these arrangements, but the German side got almost nothing out of them.<a class="footnote">97</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			The outbreak of war in September 1939 between Germany on the one hand and England and France on the other, threw these arrangements between Farben and Standard into a certain amount of legal confusion which need not be explored here. Farben wished to clarify the confusion and so a meeting was arranged at the Hague, September 22, at which certain legal arrangements were made. Standard official Frank A. Howard was puzzled by all of this:<a class="footnote">98</a>
		</p>
		<p class="Indented">
			I could not escape the conviction, however, that the Germans themselves were the only people who could profit from a military standpoint by leaving the relations between Standard and the I.G. in the situation into which the war had thrown them.
		</p>
		<p>
			The arrangements which had been made at the Hague soon proved to be inadequate so it was decided in the spring of 1940 that another meeting was necessary. Howard saw another motivation for an additional meeting:
		</p>
		<p class="Indented">
			&hellip; we intended also to ask them to supply some of their detailed designs of manufacturing equipment and technique for Buna. We hoped that I.G. might obtain permission of its government to sell to us the plans for the Buna polymerization plants they had erected in Germany under the government program.
		</p>
		<p>
			These hopes were dashed at the conference between Standard and Farben which finally took place in Basle, Switzerland in mid-April 1940, during the German occupation of Norway which signalled the end of the Sitzkrieg. The new political conditions arising from the German realization that the situation was a serious one brought about at the conference the effective termination of the relations between Farben and Standard. Naturally Standard got nowhere with its proposals to buy plant designs. However, as Howard explains:
		</p>
		<p class="Indented">
			One other point was very much on our minds. We wanted to make sure, if possible, that the Germans had not, since the outbreak of the war in Europe, made any radical change in their Buna manufacturing processes or formulas. Direct questions were out of order, since the I.G. men could not discuss any phase of Germany's industrial war effort. But during the settlements of patent transfers and discussions of license definitions needed to implement the Hague agreement, we obtained sufficient data to feel sure that all of the fundamentals of the Buna operation had remained unchanged. This conclusion was later fully confirmed.
		</p>
		<p>
			This was the &quot;last direct contact Standard had with the Germans on Buna rubber.&quot;<a class="footnote">99</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			All American knowledge of the Buna processes, which made the American war effort possible, came from these relationships with I.G. Farben, and this is accepted fact in the rubber industry.<a class="footnote">100</a> Nevertheless Standard later came under some rather stupid criticism and even later legal action on account of them.<a class="footnote">101</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			The sudden unavailability in 1942 of a source of rubber set off a major political crisis in the United States. There had been a Buna program in existence since mid-1940, when the Rubber Reserve Corporation had been created within the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. This agency, headed by Jesse H. Jones, supervised the stockpiling of reserve crude rubber and also sponsored the construction of Buna plants, which started in 1941. However, nobody in authority had foreseen the complete loss of the Far East rubber, so the synthetic rubber program had been modest in scope. Consequently, in 1942 there was almost no practical experience with large scale use of the Farben processes.
		</p>
		<p>
			The emergency had been realized immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor since, three days later, the U.S. Government had banned the sale of new automobile tires for civilian purposes. General rationing of rubber followed quickly. Early in 1942 it became realized that, if there was to be any American war effort, a gigantic synthetic rubber industry would have to be created in record time. The apparently dismal prospects for such an achievement were the cause of some amount of panic and, naturally, scapegoats were sought. Jesse Jones was a favorite target, and his claim that 300,000 tons of synthetic rubber would be produced in 1943, and 600,000 tons in 1944, was jeered at (U.S. rubber consumption in 1940 was 648,500 tons). Standard Oil also came in for outrageously unfair abuse by people who interpreted the Farben-Standard agreements as a conspiracy to restart synthetic rubber development in the U.S. Harry S. Truman, chairman of a Senate committee which investigated war production problems, first became prominent in connection with the rubber crisis of 1942.
		</p>
		<p>
			The crisis also set off internal political conflicts. The big oil interests had a long lead in the production of Buna-S, but the farm block was dominant in Congress. Now, Buna can be made not only from coal and oil, but also from alcohol, an agricultural product. Foreseeing the birth of a major new industry, the farm interests started arguing in favor of making Buna from alcohol (the most expensive method). They cited the fact that the Russians, produced a Polish refugee who was supposed to have made some revolutionary invention in connection with making Buna from alcohol.
		</p>
		<p>
			There was another political block tied up with South American interests, which proposed subsidies for plantations. There was also a small farm bloc which pressed for more extensive planting of the guayule plant in the southwest. The effect of these internal political battles was to generate massive confusion and retard the progress of the existing U.S. Buna program.
		</p>
		<p>
			The rubber crisis filled the press in 1942 and was, in fact, the major crisis which the U.S. faced in connection with the war. There was constant lamenting that Germany was well ahead of the U.S., and that the U.S. lacked the vital experience with the processes that the Germans possessed. Methods being used in Germany were cited in connection with discussing the prospects of the U.S. program. / 7
		</p>
		<p>
			The farm bloc's battle against what it called the &quot;oily interests&quot; achieved a temporary major success in July 1942 when the Congress passed the weird &quot;Rubber Supply Act of 1942.&quot; The Act would have established a new agency for rubber production, entirely under the control of Congress and outside the domain of the War Production Board, the Army, the Navy or any executive agency of the Government. Of course, the Act also specified that the rubber was to be made from grain alcohol. President Roosevelt vetoed this bill on August 6, and announced the appointment of a committee to study the rubber problem and make some recommendations in regard to the organization of an American synthetic rubber program: &quot;probably the most widely acclaimed action on the domestic front in the history of the war program.&quot; The members of the committee were Dr. James D. Conant, President of Harvard, Dr. Karl T. Compton, President of M.I.T., and the financier and political leader Bernard M. Baruch, who served as Chairman. The committee is normally referred to as the Baruch Committee. / 8
		</p>
		<p>
			These three men were chosen partially because they were not considered connected with any specific interests in the conflict, and also because of their expertise. The appointment of Baruch as Chairman of such a technically oriented group may seem peculiar at first, but this is not the case. Besides being a man of divers talents and important financial, industrial and political connections, he had chaired the War Industries Board during World War I. Moreover, for a period of more than thirty years he had been interested in industrial ventures involving rubber and had independently inventoried, with war requirement in mind, American rubber stocks in the spring of 1941. As a consequence he had gotten into fights with various people, mainly Jesse H. Jones. In addition, unlike the usual chairman of a &quot;name&quot; Washington ad hoc committee, Baruch threw all his energy into the work of the Committee. His assistant Sam Lubell also was put to work on the Committee's assignment. Even after the issuing of the final report Baruch maintained interest since Howard reports that Baruch later expressed a wish to speak to the Standard people, and that a meeting was accordingly held, at which the major technical-economic problems were discussed. / 9
		</p>
		<p>
			The work of the Baruch Committee was completed with remarkable speed and the final report was issued on September 10, 1942; the best explanation for this speed would appear to be Baruch's independent prior involvement in the problem.
		</p>
		<p>
			We must attempt to see this problem as the Committee much have seen it in 1942. Primarily, it was a political problem requiring the reconciliation of the various interests contending for the synthetic rubber business. Thus the final report of the Committee recommended the creation of a capacity to produce 100,000,000 gallons of additional grain alcohol per year. A second problem involved the lack of practical American experience with the Buna processes. Technical specifications were at hand, but there existed many questions on many details and quite a few alternative versions of the processes. Thus, in order to accelerate the American synthetic rubber program, the Baruch Committee saw a need to learn as much as possible of the experiences of others. It made a specific recommendation that an immediate effort be made to learn the experiences of the Russians in the production of synthetic rubber and make use of them in the American program (Jesse Jones had been charged with overlooking this possibility). The effort was made but yielded no results of any value. / 10 Under such conditions it is necessary to assume that somebody in America looked into new developments in Germany in as close detail as possible at the time, and the new German development in rubber in 1942 was Auschwitz, the site of the most advanced developments in Buna rubber at that time.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Auschwitz of Great Interest to Americans
		</h3>
		<p>
			The point to be made in our discussion of the American rubber crisis of 1942 is that American intelligence must have known what was going on at Auschwitz in that year. Clearly, it would be delightful if we could learn exactly what U.S. military intelligence knew about events in and around Germany during the war. However, intelligence agencies are notoriously reluctant to release such information, even many years after the events in question. With respect to World War II intelligence operations, a few sensational episodes are known but, on the whole, the content of Allied intelligence information has not been divulged. The intelligence relative to Auschwitz will be a long, long time in being made public, if it is ever made public.
		</p>
		<p>
			In attempting to estimate, therefore, what information was possessed by Allied intelligence agencies, one must proceed very much on the basis of common sense. The difficulty is that my common sense may differ very much from another's, and that agreement on such matters may be most difficult to arrive at. Now, my common sense tells me that, quite apart from the rubber crisis, Allied intelligence would have known, in mid-1942, what was happening at the largest German concentration camp. If additionally, as every version of the extermination legend asserts, there had been anything as outr&eacute; as a program of systematic extermination of Jews at Auschwitz in the summer of 1942, then my common sense tells me that it is a certainty that U.S. military intelligence would have known about it.
		</p>
		<p>
			If another's common sense does not lead him to the same conclusion it is very doubtful that the disagreement could be settled by discussion. However with Auschwitz we have the fact that it was of interest not only as a large concentration camp (and also, if the extermination claims were correct, an extermination camp), but also as the site of the most advanced developments in synthetic rubber. In 1942, no location in the German Reich was of greater interest, and no industrial operations of greater strategic importance. Therefore, if one wishes to claim that U.S. (or the closely related British) intelligence did not know what was happening at Auschwitz in the summer of 1942, then I am afraid that one must logically claim the complete ignorance and incompetence of these intelligence agencies.
		</p>
		<p>
			Auschwitz was of the greatest interest to the U.S. in mid-1942 on account of its enormous technological significance. Above we saw Howard's great interest, in 1940, in any information about possible new developments that could be obtained directly or inferred indirectly. A similar interest on the part of the Americans in 1942 must be assumed. It is a certainty that intelligence had developed the basic facts about the industry at Auschwitz: a plant for hydrogenation and other chemical processes aimed at producing gasoline and rubber. It has been seen that each one of the German Buna rubber plants employed processes differing in important details from the others and that the Auschwitz process were to be the beneficiary of accumulated experiences with several different versions. We are thus justified in assuming, on account of the peculiar urgency of the rubber problem and the peculiar position of Auschwitz relative to this urgency, that the intelligence had gone into unusual detail in regard to Auschwitz, probably going over every inch via aerial photographic intelligence, and that the assembled information was available to various people in the U.S. The information probably included many details not greatly relevant to the rubber problem, such as the employment of prisoner and POW labor at Auschwitz.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although concealment of information had been the rule in the area of military intelligence, we can nevertheless assume that the means of gathering intelligence data on Auschwitz included more or less conventional methods: exploitation of contracts with commercial representatives of Farben who were stationed in neutral countries (Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Sweden, Switzerland), aerial photographic intelligence (aircraft used for such purposes may always have longer ranges than bombers on account of their lack of armaments), general knowledge of German industrial and economic matters, spies and informers in German industry and in the German Government (e.g. Admiral Canaris), and informers in the employ of advantageously situated neutral organizations (such as the Swiss and Swedish diplomatic corps and also firms doing business in Germany). Although all of these means no doubt played a role, photographic intelligence was probably particularly important; the technology of photographic intelligence had attained a respectable level in 1942 so that a &quot;you are there&quot; effect was possible in blown-up aerial photos of even heavily defended positions. There were other channels of information, whose nature and existence are of some particular importance here, and which will be discussed in due course.
		</p>
		<p>
			Not being sufficiently acquainted with he technical problems that were associated with Buna at the time, we have no idea what information the Americans might have been after and how it could be inferred from the intelligence data, any more than we have an understanding of what questions were on the minds of the Standard people at the Basle meeting and how partial answers could be inferred from the legal ritual that took place at that meeting. We can, however, offer one possibility by way of example without any claim that such was the specific case.
		</p>
		<p>
			We have seen that the first German Buna plant at Schkopau employed a carbide-acetylene-butadiene process and that at the Huels plant the process was hydrocarbons-acetylene-butadiene. The new plant at Ludwighsafen, nearing completion when the Baruch Committee was meeting, had reverted to making the acetylene from carbide and had modernized the acetylene to butadiene state. Since either a carbide or a hydrocarbons process was potentially applicable to the processes to be employed in the U.S. (which could have started from oil or grain alcohol) it was no doubt of great interest whether Auschwitz was to employ a carbide process (as was the case), suggesting abandonment of the hydrocarbons version on the basis of the Huels experience, or was to employ a hydrocarbons or other process, suggesting failure to make a commitment to carbide processes. Moreover the carbide vs. hydrocarbons question could probably be answered on the basis of aerial intelligence, if necessary.
		</p>
		<p>
			What was the ultimate value, in terms of the problems the Americans faced, of the detailed information about contemporary German Buna developments which, we feel certain, they examined closely approximately in middle-late 1942? Perhaps none, as was the case with most categories of information; it is just that you don't miss a bet in the sort of situation in which the Americans found themselves regarding rubber in 1942.
		</p>
		<p>
			Consideration of technical matters has been necessary here because it was in a technical context that Auschwitz first became prominent in Washington. However it is not the technical matters that have been our objective here but simply the fact of prominence, or heavy exposure, in U.S. inner circles in the summer of 1942; this is the only point relevant to our subject. We have no direct evidence of this but we have reviewed reasons why such exposure must be assumed. It remains to show that events at Auschwitz at this time were such as to actually suggest an &quot;extermination factory&quot; charge to those in the inner political circles, who were alert to the appearance of semi-factual bases for atrocity stories. The events at Auschwitz in late 1942 &mdash; early 1943, will be covered in a second context in the next chapter, and hence are not annotated here.
		</p>
		<p>
			The eeriest aspect that Auschwitz must have presented while the Baruch Committee was meeting was that of the site of a ghost factory; starting around August 1 the Buna plant had been closed. There was no activity to be seen except possibly an occasional watchman. This must have excited great curiosity and no doubt special steps were taken to find out what was going on.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our ugly old friend typhus was at Auschwitz; an epidemic had shut the Buna plant down for two months, so that work did not resume until late September. By this time there were a number of dead which must have been a few thousand, although there is a large degree of uncertainty here. The German policy was to cremate the bodies of camp inmates who died, but the epidemic caught the Auschwitz authorities with inadequate crematory facilities. There was a small crematory at Auschwitz I but more extensive facilities at Birkenau, plans for which existed in January 1942, were yet under construction in 1942 and the first complete new unit, consisting of fifteen conventional crematory ovens, was not to be available until January 1943. It appears that many of the victims of the epidemic were immediately cremated in pits, but it is possible that many were buried, at least temporarily. That the Germans were constructing crematoria at Birkenau was probably evident to continued Allied surveillance (which we assume existed) in the autumn of 1942. The buildings which the Birkenau ovens were installed in had certain halls, rooms, or cellars which the accusations say were the &quot;gas chambers.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			Several books offer versions of Fig. 7, which is claimed to be a photograph of gassed victims about to be burned in pits, taken by an Auschwitz inmate in 1944. / 11 We have no way of knowing when, where or by whom it was taken. However such scenes were common at Auschwitz in 1942, when the camp presumably attained some prominence in Allied intelligence. Indeed the poor quality of the picture caused some initial speculation on my part that it is an aerial intelligence photograph; the low angle does not rule out the possibility since such angles were frequently attained even with highly defended positions. / 12 Also, the versions I examined in the various books do not have the border material which tends to support the claim that it was taken on the ground. Our Fig. 7 is reproduced from a print obtained in 1973 from the museum operated by the Polish government at Auschwitz, and there remain a number of mysteries concerning it. The version reproduced here is the only one, so far as I know, that is not obviously falsified to some extent. However such an observation does not settle the matter because of the strange fact that the falsified (or, at least, retouched) versions display more apparently genuine background detail (e.g. the fence and trees).
		</p>
		<p>
			In any case Birkenau was, in a very real sense a &quot;death camp;&quot; dead, dying and sick people were sent there and, after the crematoria were built, the dead were disposed of in them. If one is to claim an &quot;extermination camp&quot; when there is none, what better choice is there but a &quot;death camp.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			While the preceding adequately suggests how the Auschwitz lie originated, it is not relevant to the circumstances under which the more general extermination legend originated. The claims of exterminations of Jews have their origin not in Allied intelligence information but in the operations of the World Jewish Congress, whose leaders were at first either unconcerned with, or uninformed about, the facts pertaining to Auschwitz.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this connection one must reject two possible fallacious expectations. The first is that Allied propaganda would strive to maximize Auschwitz propaganda after it was realized that the propaganda possibilities were excellent. The second is that the claims made in the Allied propaganda relative to Auschwitz would be almost completely devoid of real fact.
		</p>
		<p>
			If, as is claimed here, there was no German extermination program but certain propagandists in the U.S. wished the acceptance of the thesis that there was, it would have been a most serious blunder for the propagandists to give maximum emphasis to Auschwitz or any other place as an alleged extermination camp for this would amount to making a charge that the Germans could answer. If high U.S. officials, such as Roosevelt or his cabinet members, had made specific remarks about exterminations, naming sites where exterminations were taking place, under circumstances where their remarks received the wide publicity normally given to public statements by officials of their rank, then both the Germans and the Allies would have been put on the spot on the question and the truth would not have been long in coming out. On the contrary, as we shall see in a later chapter, the first period in which there was a persistence of references to Auschwitz as an extermination camp, appearing even under obscure circumstances, was immediately after D-Day (June 6, 1944), when nobody was paying any attention to such stories. Later in the summer of 1944, the emphasis shifted to the Lublin camp, which the Russians had just captured. The first reference to emerge from a U.S. Government source which was high enough so that it could not be ignored, and which charged exterminations at Auschwitz, came in late November 1944, after the exterminations are supposed to have been terminated.<a class="footnote">102</a> Otherwise, people such as Roosevelt and Churchill and their ministers spoke only in very general moralistic terms about exterminations. It is only if one believed there actually were exterminations taking place at Auschwitz, and one wanted to stop them, that one would have made a specific charge concerning Auschwitz to which the Germans would have felt obliged to respond. No such challenge ever materialized. Despite the fact that in all versions of the extermination legend the Auschwitz exterminations had certainly started by the late summer of 1942, and despite the fact that U.S. military intelligence must have known whatever it was that was going on at Auschwitz at that time, no specific extermination charges came from any high source until much later.
		</p>
		<p>
			The second fallacious expectation is that American propaganda relative to Auschwitz would be almost free of fact. We have indicated already that this should not be expected. Washington had excellent and accurate information about Auschwitz, as it had about all important phases of German industrial activity, and it had been remarked above that the real facts about Birkenau seemed to invite distortion of interpretation.
		</p>
		<h3>
			The First &lsquo;Extermination&rsquo; Claims and Washington
		</h3>
		<p>
			The first &quot;inside&quot; events relative to the extermination propaganda were in the context of a conflict involving the U.S. State and Treasury Departments and the World Jewish Congress (and American Jewish Congress), headed by Rabbi Stephen S. Wise. The prominent character in the story are Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, later the nominal authority of the notorious &quot;Morgenthau Plan&quot; for the despoliation of Germany, Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles, who were mildly reluctant to be carried along by the propaganda, and Assistant Secretary of State J. Breckenridge Long, who was very resistant to the propaganda. Also involved are the World Jewish Congress representatives in Switzerland, Gerhard Riegner and Professor Paul Guggenheim, who transmitted stories of supposedly European origin to Wise or to their persons in the U.S., notably to the State Department through the U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland, Leland Harrison, or through the U.S. Consul in Geneva, Paul C. Squire. the principal work that has set forth the events surrounding the birth of the extermination legend is Arthur D. Morse's While Six Million Died, a book which is supplemented to some extent by Henry L. Feingold's The Politics of Rescue. Additional material had been contributed by post-war accounts given by Morgenthau, by historians J.M. Blum and Anthony Kubek (in interpreting Morgenthau's papers, the latter for the U.S. Senate publication Morgenthau Diary), historian F.L. Israel (in summarizing the papers of J. Breckenridge Long), and J. DuBois, who was at first Chief Counsel of the Treasury's Foreign Funds Control, involved in these matters chiefly in connection with efforts to extend assistance to refugees. / 14
		</p>
		<p>
			The first extermination claim appears to have been made by the London section of the World Jewish Congress in June 1942. It was claimed that one million Jews had been killed in some undesignated and unlocated &quot;vast slaughterhouse for Jews&quot; which had been established in Eastern Europe. The only attempt to provide evidence for this claim was a remark that the Polish government in exile in London had received confirming information. The allegation was carried in the New York Times in a story that will be reviewed below.
		</p>
		<p>
			The evidence for this London claim was obviously too flimsy to serve as effective propaganda, so an effort was made to improve matters slightly. On August 8, 1942 Riegner and Guggenheim approached the U.S. Consulate in Geneva, which had been cooperating with the World Jewish Congress to the extent of allowing it to use diplomatic channels for messages, with a story that some anonymous German industrialist had informed them that he had learned of a decision to kill all non-Soviet Jews under German control. Discussions, which the industrialist had overheard, were being held in the F&uuml;hrer's Headquarters regarding the methods to be employed. One method under discussion was gassing with Prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide gas) after the Jews had been concentrated at camps in Eastern Europe. This story was forwarded to Washington by the Consulate, via U.S. diplomatic channels, and to London via British diplomatic channels. The &quot;industrialist&quot; has remained anonymous to this day.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the U.S. State Department received the message, it was evaluated and it was decided that
		</p>
		<p class="Indented">
			&hellip; it does not appear advisable in view of the &hellip; fantastic nature of the allegations and the impossibility of our being of any assistance if such action were taken, to transmit the information to Dr. Wise as suggested.
		</p>
		<p>
			The message was accordingly suppressed, but Wise learned of its contents anyway. It is said that he learned from London, but it is also possible that he had composed the message in the first place, and learned of its transmission and suppression through his various connections.
		</p>
		<p>
			Wise immediately contacted Welles, who had approved the decision to suppress, in order to protest the State Department's handling of the matter. Welles replied that the &quot;information&quot; was somewhat too unsubstantiated to be taken seriously, and that some confirmation should be obtained before any public announcement was made. Welles then instructed the U.S. representative in the Vatican to attempt to check the allegations with Vatican sources. At the time, almost nobody in Washington pretended to take these claims seriously, and even President Roosevelt assured Justice Felix Frankfurter that the Jews who had been deported to the East were merely being used to help build fortifications.
		</p>
		<p>
			In September two anonymous persons showed up in Geneva, claiming to have escaped from German controlled areas. They reported the extermination of Polish Jews and the utilization of the Jewish corpses for the manufacture of fertilizer. This was forwarded to Washington through diplomatic channels, and again an attempt was made to get confirmation by the Vatican (which had thus far ignored the first request for confirmation). At about the same time, Wise had received a message from a World Jewish Congress official in Europe reporting on the &quot;manufacture of soap and artificial fertilizer&quot; from Jewish corpses.
		</p>
		<p>
			In late September Riegner came forward with two new documents. The first had, he said, been prepared by an (anonymous, naturally) officer attached to the German High Command, and had reached Riegner through several intermediaries. The anonymous officer claimed that there were at least two factories in existence which were manufacturing soap, glue and lubricants from Jewish corpses, and that it had been determined that each Jewish corpse was worth 50 Reichmarks. The second document consisted of two coded letters which had, it was said, been written by a Swiss Jew resident in Warsaw. The anonymous Jew reported wholesale exterminations of Warsaw Jews deported to the East. All of these messages were forwarded to Washington and then filed.
		</p>
		<p>
			In passing we should note the resemblance of such claims to World War I propaganda, and the appalling lack of originality and creativity on the part of the World Jewish Congress. It scarcely requires remarking that the soap and glue factories were a very transient propaganda phenomenon, and that the only similar charges made at Nuremberg were made by the Russians. These charges were largely ignored even then and nobody, to my knowledge, has since come forward with the locations of these factories, the identities of the persons who managed them, or similar information. Reitlinger does not claim the existence of such factories, and Hilberg (p. 624) does not believe they existed.
		</p>
		<p>
			On October 10 the Vatican finally informed the U.S. representatives that it had been unable to confirm the many reports it had heard of severe measures against the Jews.
		</p>

			On October 22 Riegner met with Ambassador Harrison and presented him with more of the same sort of &quot;evidence,&quot; this time reporting &quot;information&quot; provided by yet another anonymous German Informant (whose name, however, is said to have been presented to Harrison in a sealed envelope, and to have been kept secret from everybody but the OSS) and also an anonymous official of the International Red Cross. Harrison forwarded this material to Washington, but also wrote two personal letters to Welles in late October, claiming that he knew the name of the German industrialist, and also claiming that the anonymous Red Cross official was Karl Jacob Burkhardt, the distinguished Voltaire-Goethe scholar who was prominent in the International Red Cross during the war. He enclosed an affidavit that Guggenheim had deposed before Squire on October 29, in which Guggenheim claimed that he had obtained from an anonymous German informant information confirming Riegner's claims. The anonymous German informant had gotten his information from an anonymous official of the German Foreign Ministry, and from an anonymous official of the German Ministry of War. Moreover, an anonymous Swiss informant, resident in Belgrade, had also given information to Guggenheim supporting the claims.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to confirm the claims, Squire arranged an interview with Burkhardt, which took place in Geneva on November 7. On November 9 Squire communicated to Harrison his memorandum on the interview, in which he had recorded that Burkhardt's information was that Hitler had signed an order that before the end of 1942 Germany must be free of all Jews. Squire's account of the interview explains: / 15

			I then asked him whether the word extermination, or its equivalent, was employed, to which he replied that the words must be Juden-frei (free of Jews) were utilized. He then made it clear that since there is no place to send these Jews and since the territory must be cleared of this race, it is obvious what the net result would be.
		</p>
		<p>
			This, the report of an ambiguous remark, made by an imperfectly informed Swiss citizen, reported by an intermediary who was friendly to the World Jewish Congress and eager to discover a sinister interpretation to such facts as were available, is as solid as this &quot;evidence&quot; ever got. To my knowledge, Burkhardt never spoke out publicly, during or after the war, in connection with these matters. He answered some written questions which were put to him by Kaltenbrunner's defense during the IMT trial, but these questions, relating to Kaltenbrunner's efforts to permit the Red Cross to enter the German camps toward the end of the war, were not relevant to our subject. Nobody asked Burkhardt about exterminations. / 16

			Late in November, the State Department received &quot;information&quot; from an anonymous Vatican source, consisting of a three page description, in French, of events allegedly transpiring in Poland. The document is unsigned and the only sort of endorsement is a handwritten notation, &quot;from Mr. F at Vatican City,&quot; which appears in an unknown hand on the first page. The document reports, inter alia / 17

			During the late summer and autumn of 1942, Wise had continuously campaigned for the Allied governments to take a public position directly condemning the alleged exterminations of Jews in Europe. On December 8 Wise led a delegation to the White House and presented to President Roosevelt a twenty page document entitled Blue Print for Extermination, which was based on the sort of &quot;information&quot; we have reviewed. Related Jewish pressures finally brought capitulation to Wise on the mythical exterminations, and on December 17, 1942, the Allies, led by Washington, issued a statement condemning the exterminations. A related statement, released two days later, claimed exterminations at Belzec and at Chelmno, but Auschwitz was not mentioned (the relevant news stories are reviewed below).
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite this public declaration, the group headed by J. Breckenridge Long continued to resist the propaganda. On January 19, 1943 Riegner gave Harrison the &quot;information&quot; that &quot;in one place in Poland 6,000 Jews are killed daily.&quot; On January 21 Harrison communicated this material to the State Department and also to certain unspecified &quot;private Jewish agencies,&quot; apparently meaning Wise. The message was merely filed an the Department made no public mention of it. For a time, the private Jewish agencies went also silent about the message. On February 10 Long's group took a further step in suppression of such propaganda. It instructed Harrison, in a message signed by Welles (who is said to have not read the message), and with particular reference to Harrison's cable of January 21,
		</p>
		<p class="Indented">
			In the future, reports submitted to you for transmission to private persons on the United States should not be accepted unless extraordinary circumstances make such action advisable. It is felt that by sending such private messages which circumvent neutral countries&rsquo; censorship we risk the possibility that neutral countries might find it necessary to take steps to curtail or abolish our official secret means of communication.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, on February 14, the New York Times published the story. For explanation of the delay of four weeks in publishing the story, despite its being received by &quot;private Jewish agencies&quot; on January 21, and despite the evident policy of publishing the unsupported claims of such agencies, we can only conjecture that certain unknown persons were hoping that the State Department, given the precedent of the declaration of December 17, would release the &quot;information&quot; so as to confer a greater credibility than would have been granted to the story as it eventually appeared: a claim indistinguishable in terms of authority from the average sort of atrocity claim.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Treasury (which, because of Morgenthau's long crusade against Germany, had repeatedly interfered in the conduct of foreign affairs since at least 1936) / 18 was soon to come into conflict with State over this suppression. A second and more substantial basis for conflict between the two Departments was also established in February 1943. It was learned that the Rumanian Government was prepared to transfer 70,000 Jews to Palestine on Rumanian ships bearing Vatican insignia (it is unlikely that the Rumanians really cared where the Jews sent to, so I assume that the Palestine destination must have been somehow specified by the Zionists involved in the formulation of the proposals). An important condition was specified by &quot;officials who were in charge in Rumania of Jewish interests.&quot; A cost of 250 pounds (about $1200) per capita was specified. There were other difficulties. The British policy at the time was not to antagonize the Arabs, especially in view of the potentially catastrophic consequences of an Arab uprising in wartime, and thus the British at first refused to consider the admission of so many Jews to Palestine. The British took the position that if such Jews were to be taken out of Europe, the U.S. should provide camps in North Africa for them. In addition, both the British Foreign Office and the U.S. State Department took the position that there would inevitably be spies in such a large group of people, that the logistical problems involved in transporting and accommodating such numbers were formidable, and that the money demanded might fall into the hands of the enemy (who valued Allied currency for various purposes). The Treasury was eager to get into the business of aiding Jewish refugees and thus it sought to overcome such objections. By July 1943 there was said to be bribe money demanded for the Rumanian Jews, $170,000, and the Treasury and the World Jewish Congress proposed that Rumanian Jewish businessmen could produce the bribe money if they could be reimbursed after the war with money to be held in escrow in Switzerland. However the British objections to admitting Jews to Palestine stood, and efforts to circumvent them by proposing other destinations for the Jews ran into the opposition of various candidate countries and also into U.S. immigration laws.
		</p>
		<p>
			The State Department, especially J. Breckenridge Long and associates, considered all the talk about &quot;exterminations&quot; to be just wartime propaganda invention, in the same spirit as the stories invented during World War I. They were, after all, continually considering proposals to move these exterminated people out of Europe; as late as January 1944 the Department was taking steps to encourage Jews to leave Poland for Hungary. Long wrote that one danger in supporting the proposals of Wise was that it &quot;may lend color to the charges of Hitler that we are fighting this war on account of an at the instigation and direction of our Jewish citizens.&quot; State considered the whole project pointless and, indeed, in conflict with the requirements of an optimum war effort. Long wrote that
		</p>
		<p class="Indented">
			Wise always assumes such a sanctimonious air and pleads for the &quot;intellectuals and brave spirits, refugees from the tortures of the dictators&quot; or words to that effect. Of course only an infinitesimal fraction of the immigrants are of that category &mdash; and some are certainly German agents &hellip; I did not allude to the Navemar &mdash; en route from Lisbon to Havana and New York &mdash; a freight boat, passenger accommodations for 15 and 1200 poor Jews above and below decks with no sanitary arrangements, no service, no kitchen facilities, at from $800 to $1500 apiece, 4 dead before reaching Burmuda, 6 hospitalized there, 1 of which died, victims of the greed of their fellows &mdash; not of Germany or the United States policy. The vessel is a menace to the health of any port where it stops and a shame to the human greed which makes it possible. But I did not allude to it in reply to Rabbi Wise. Each one of these men hates me. I am to them the embodiment of a nemesis. The each and all believe every person, everywhere, has a right to come to the United States. I believe nobody, anywhere has a right to enter the United States unless the United States desires.
		</p>
		<p>
			The State Department either procrastinated on the matter or actively sabotaged the proposed project. At the end of the summer of 1943 it was learned that 6,000 Jewish children could be taken out of France, and this possibility got involved in the problem.
		</p>
		<p>
			The people from the Treasury and the World Jewish Congress kept pressing for the proposed projects and continually asserted, with apparent complete seriousness, that the only alternative was the death of the people in question at the hands of Hitler. It was evenly openly charged that the failure to approve the projects was &quot;acquiescence of this Government in the murder of the Jews.&quot; Pressure was also put on the British by various people. Long had become a whipping boy both publicly and within Government circles, and he wrote bitterly that &quot;the Jewish agitation depends on attacking some individual. Otherwise they would have no publicity. So for the time being I am the bull's eye.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			As a result of this campaign, a breakthrough was achieved by Wise and Morgenthau in December 1943, when arrangements were finally made for the evacuation of Rumanian Jews and money was put into a Swiss account controlled by Riegner and the U.S. Treasury. Moreover, in December Rumania put out peace feelers and was assured it would be treated well if it treated its Jews well; Rumania immediately decided to repatriate Jews it had resettled by the Sea of Azov in Russia.
		</p>
		<p>
			This Morgenthau victory had been achieved at a December 20 meeting of Hull, Long, Morgenthau and John Pehle, chief of the Treasury's Foreign Funds Control. Morgenthau had evidently decided on a showdown with State over the entire matter for at that meeting he casually requested a copy of the complete text of the February 10 message from Welles to Harrison (the suppression instruction). The State Department complied, but deleted the reference to Harrison's message of January 21, thereby causing the message of February 10 to appear utterly routine. In this editing the message, State was obviously unaware that the complete contents of this correspondence had already been leaked to DuBois in the Treasury by Donald Hiss of the State Department (brother of Alger Hiss and later identified in Bentley-Chambers testimony as a Communist, although he denied it), who had acquired copies of the messages only with great difficulty and, in complying with DuBois&rsquo; request, nevertheless cautioned the latter that the messages were &quot;none of Treasury's business&quot; and that Hiss could lose his job for the leak. / 19
		</p>
		<p>
			When Morgenthau received the edited message he knew that he had another weapon to use against Long and associates and, thus, he brought on a collision by charging editing of the message and demanding to see the unedited files, which were produced shortly later, exposing State's clumsy attempt at concealment. The State Department people were now very much on the defensive, and further examination of the State Department files (which the Treasury was now in a position to insist on) revealed that, in response to a request by Wise, Welles had cabled Harrison in April to meet with Riegner and transmit new information that Riegner was supposed to have obtained. The confused Harrison did as requested (Riegner's information had to do with proposals to assist Jewish refugees in France and Rumania) and also remarked to Welles that such material should not be subjected to the restriction imposed by the February 10 message.
		</p>
		<p>
			Morgenthau was victorious in the State-Treasury collision; Roosevelt, drawn into the issue, sided with him by establishing in January 1944 the so-called War Refugee Board consisting of Morgenthau, Hull and Secretary of War Stimson. However the executive director was &quot;Morgenthau's fair haired boy,&quot; John Pehle, and Josiah DuBois was the general counsel. It was thus Morgenthau's Board. The WRB naturally acquired the powers that had been held by the three Government Departments that were involved in the proposed projects for taking Jews out of Europe. Thus, the State Department became committed to appointing special attach&eacute;s with diplomatic status on the recommendation of the Board (the UNRRA, set up the previous November, was to have a similar function but only after the war ended). / 20
		</p>
		<p>
			In order for the reader to completely grasp the nature of its development, and its import in terms of our subject, we should go beyond noting the obvious fact that the WRB was to serve, to a great extent, as simply an instrument of the World Jewish Congress and other Zionist organizations. The Communist apparatus was also one of the directors involved, for the person to whom Morgenthau had delegated all of the Treasury's powers in the areas relevant to the WRB was Harry Dexter White, later exposed as a Soviet agent. White became a member of Morgenthau's inner circle in the spring of 1938. A week after Pearl Harbor, Morgenthau announced that &quot;on and after this date, Mr. Harry D. White, Assistant to the Secretary, will assume full responsibility for all matters with which the Treasury Department has to deal having a bearing on foreign relations &hellip;&quot; The extreme generality of the wording of this order, especially the phrase &quot;having a bearing on,&quot; were to create grand opportunities for White in the years ahead. In early 1943 Morgenthau amplified White's responsibilities:
		</p>
		<p class="Indented">
			Effective this date, I would like you to take supervision over and assume full responsibility for Treasury's participation in all economic and financial matters &hellip; in connection with the operations of the Army and Navy and the civilian affairs in the foreign areas in which our Armed Forces are operating or are likely to operate. This will, of course, include general liaison with the State Department, Army and Navy, and other departments or agencies and representatives of foreign governments on these matters.
		</p>
		<p>
			White, who became an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in early 1945, took full advantage of these powers, especially in connection with occupation policy in Germany. It is also evident that, since the WRB was to a large degree an arm of the Treasury, its operations fell into White's domain. It is also worth remarking that the general counsel of the WRB, Dubois, was &quot;closely associated&quot; with the Communist agent, William L. Ullmann, and was also a witness of White's will. / 21
		</p>
		<p>
			Long had mixed and, as it developed, prescient thoughts about the implications of these developments:
		</p>
		<p class="Indented">
			&hellip; it will be only a few more days now before I relinquish jurisdiction in connection with refugees and let somebody else have the fun. And it had been a heavy responsibility &mdash; domestic as well as foreign, because there are 5 million Jews in the country, of whom 4 million are concentrated in and around New York City. And we have no Arab or Moslem population, but we do have increasingly important commercial interests &mdash; principally oil &mdash; in the Moslem countries. In addition our ally England has hardly any Jewish citizenship but a very large political interest in the Near East. So our policy is increasingly based in part &mdash; a large part &mdash; on a domestic situation, while England's is based entirely on a foreign affairs base &mdash; and the two are hard to reconcile &hellip; it is good news for me &hellip; this ensures me staying out. What they can do that I have not done I cannot imagine.
		</p>
		<p>
			Long miscalculated on the last point for the WRB eventually did a considerable amount of Jew relocation, and its acts on behalf of refugees are of great importance in this book and are discussed in a later chapter. It also aided concentration camp inmates, through the Red Cross, in the final weeks of the war. / 22 As an instrument of Wise and other Zionists, the WRB also did considerable propagandizing / 23 and its most consequential propaganda achievement was a booklet, German Extermination Camps: Auschwitz and Birkenau, Executive Office of the President, Washington, November 1944. The booklet is hereafter referred to as the WRB report.
		</p>
		<p>
			The WRB report constituted the formal birth of the &quot;official&quot; thesis of exterminations via gas chamber at Auschwitz. In it all of the essentials and many of the details of the later Auschwitz hoax are found. The Nuremberg charges grew out of the WRB report. There does not seem to have been any particularly strong reaction, one way or the other, to the WRB report at the time that it was issued. However, an American journalist, Oswald F. Schuette, wrote a critical letter to Stimson (one of the signers of the report), but Schuette did not get a satisfactory reply.24
		</p>
		<p>
			Of course the WRB report failed to change the opinions of the State Department people who had scoffed at the extermination propaganda from the very beginning. In private with DuBois, they were blunt in their opinion of the WRB report: &quot;Stuff like this has been coming from Bern ever since 1942 &hellip; Don't forget, this is a Jew telling about the Jews.&quot; &hellip; &quot;This is just a campaign by that Jew Morgenthau and his Jewish assistants.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			The WRB report was said to have been transmitted from Bern to Washington. The report will be discussed in depth after we have surveyed a key part of the wartime propaganda, in its public aspect. First, however, we should point out that some otherwise keen observers misinterpret the role of Auschwitz in the extermination legend. The distinguished American journalist and historian, Harry Elmer Barnes, wrote in 1967 that the extermination<a class="footnote">103</a>
		</p>
		<p class="Indented">
			&hellip; camps were first presented as those in Germany, such as Dachau, Belsen, Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen, and Dora, but it was demonstrated that there had been no systematic extermination in those camps. Attention was then moved on the Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec, Chelmno, Jonowska, Tarnow, Ravensbruck, Mauthausen, Brezeznia, and Birkenau, which does not exhaust the list that appears to have been extended as needed.
		</p>
		<p>
			The basis for Barnes&rsquo; misunderstanding, of course, is that at the end of the war the mass media, for the sake of sensation mongering did, indeed, seize on the scenes found in the German camps as proof of exterminations, and it is also true, as we indicated in the previous chapter, that these scenes have served as the mass propaganda &quot;proof&quot; of exterminations. However our analysis shows that Auschwitz had been carefully chosen in 1944 as the core for the extermination hoax. This point will be supported by material to be reviewed below and also in a later chapter. By publishing the WRB report in November 1944, Washington committed itself to a specific form of the hoax. That form was maintained in the trials in Nuremberg and, even today, the form of the hoax does not differ in any significant respect from the WRB report.
		</p>
		<p>
			After his WRB victory, Morgenthau busied himself with other things, particularly with the policies to be followed in occupied Germany. He found that existing plans actually paid regard to the Hague and Geneva Conventions, to which the United States was signatory, and which prohibited such things as the seizure of private personal property of no military significance, the detaining of POWs long after the end of hostilities, and the needless imposition of starvation rations. He therefore campaigned for the harsher policies which later became known as the Morgenthau Plan, and of which many were actually adopted and put into practice. David Marcus, in the CAD, sponsored Morgenthau's objectives there and kept him informed about his opponents. Colonel Bernard Bernstein, long associated with Morgenthau, performed a similar function for him at SHAEF headquarters in London. Baruch also helped out.<a class="footnote">104</a>

			The First &lsquo;Extermination&rsquo; Claims and New York
		</h3>
		<p>
			The thesis of this book is that the story of Jewish extermination in World War II is a propaganda hoax. Obviously, therefore, we must examine the origins of the hoax in wartime propaganda. We have already discussed many of the &quot;inside aspects, and the public aspects remain to be examined.
		</p>
		<p>
			The enormity of the task plus the &quot;controversial&quot; nature of the subject seem to have discouraged a thorough study of the propaganda. There have been studies of special aspects. John T. Flynn, in While You Slept, surveyed the propaganda in respect to communist and pro-communist influences, especially in regard to Asia. James J. Martin made a study of the manner in which the American media treated the Soviet Union, the negotiated peace question, and the allied terror bombings during the war.
		</p>
		<p>
			It would be quite out of the question to survey all of the atrocity and extermination propaganda pertaining to the European theater in World War II. Here we may economize on the magnitude of the survey to be undertaken by noting that we are interested only in the Jewish extermination question, and only in what important people were doing. We will therefore find that examination of stories concerning alleged Jewish extermination which appeared in the New York Times, spring 1942 through 1943, together with a summary of 1944 propaganda which will be presented in a subsequent chapter, is all that is required to get a satisfactory conception of the propaganda. Therefore we start here with spring 1942 stories. Concurrent commentary will be made. In many cases there is involved a story, allegedly originating in Europe, claiming mass killings and the matters of particular interest in such cases are the source of the story, the location of the alleged killings and the method of killing allegedly employed. It should also be kept in mind that the post-war extermination legend claims only three varieties of mass exterminations: gassing at six sites in Poland, &quot;gasmobiles&quot; in Russia, and mass shootings in Russia.

			April 6, 1942, p. 2: REPORTS NAZI SLAUGHTER OF JEWS. <br>
			KUIBYSHEV, Russia, April 5 (AP) &mdash; The Anti-Fascist Jewish Committee reported today that the Germans have killed 86,000 Jews in and around Minsk, 25,000 at Odessa and &quot;tens of thousands&quot; in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. In Estonia, the report said, the entire Jewish population numbering 4,500 was wiped out.

			June 13, 1942: NAZIS BLAME JEWS FOR BIG BOMBINGS. <br>
			BERLIN, June 12 (From German Broadcast recorded by the United Press in New York) &mdash; Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels said tonight that Germany would carry out a mass &quot;extermination&quot; of Jews in reprisal for the Allied air bombing of German cities which, he acknowledged, have caused heavy damage. <br>
			Dr. Goebbels, in an article in the publication The Reich, said the Jews would be exterminated throughout Europe &quot;and perhaps even beyond Europe&quot; in retaliation against the heavy air assaults.
		</p>
		<p>
			Goebbels&rsquo; remark was directed against the Jewish controlled press, which he regarded as largely responsible for the propaganda atmosphere which made the terror bombings possible. His remark in Das Reich was:
		</p>
		<p class="Indented">
			In this war the Jews are playing their most criminal game, and they will have to pay for that with the extermination (Ausrottung) of their race in Europe and perhaps far beyond. They are not to be taken seriously in this conflict, since they represent neither British nor American, but exclusively Jewish, interests.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now this is indeed an extermination threat, since the primary meaning of the term &quot;Ausrottung&quot; is &quot;extermination&quot; (the English &quot;uprooting,&quot; to which the word is related etymologically, is only a secondary meaning). Similar totally public utterances were also made occasionally by Hitler. Examples are &quot;the result of this war will be the destruction of Jewry,&quot; and &quot;it will not be the Aryan peoples that will be annihilated but it will be Jewry.&quot; / 27
		</p>
		<p>
			In reaction to this one should observe that (a) extreme statements were a pervasive feature of Nazi oratory and rhetoric, and (b) the extermination mythologists find it necessary to claim that the exterminations were carried out in the most extreme secrecy, which makes it somewhat untenable to take such occasional references in the public declarations of Nazi leaders as evidence of exterminations, and (c) it is necessary to fully grasp the specific circumstances of the Goebbels remark, i.e. it was a reaction to Allied terror bombings, and (d) people can say heated things in wartime, and bloodthirsty statements were made by supposedly responsible people on both sides during the war, and (e) it is often the case that a complete understanding of context is necessary when interpreting the specific meaning of a reference to &quot;extermination&quot; or &quot;annihilation&quot; (or, in German, &quot;Ausrottung,&quot; &quot;Vernichtung,&quot; respectively). Moreover, the German word for &quot;Jewry,&quot; das Judentum, is ambiguous in meaning. Let each of these five points be examined in order.
		</p>
		<p>
			(a) It is well known that Nazi oratory and rhetoric tended to have a provocatively inflammatory character whose origins go well back into the days when the Nazis were a minor party in Weimar Germany. It appears that this was a result of a deliberate and studied policy, for in 1931 Hitler explained the reasons for it in a private interview; / 28
		</p>
		<p class="Indented">
			What some madman of an editor writes in my own press is of no interest to me &hellip; We can achieve something only by fanaticism. If this fanaticism horrifies the bourgeoisie, so much the better. Solely by this fanaticism, which refused any compromise, do we gain our contact with the masses.
		</p>
		<p>
			Put more simply, he often found that he could get attention by making wild statements. Naturally, all of the Nazi leaders, especially Goebbels, were infected with this attitude to some degree. It is true that after the Nazis came to power and assumed responsibility for ruling Germany, their public declarations became much more moderated in tone, but the tendency never entirely departed from them, and of course the war and the problem of attempting to reach public opinion in the Allied countries revived the feature somewhat. Under the circumstances, it is actually remarkable that Hitler and Goebbels only rarely made such declarations.
		</p>
		<p>
			(b) We shall see in following chapters that the extermination mythologists are forced to take the position that the Nazis went to extremes to preserve the secrecy of their killing program of continental scope, and did in fact preserve this secrecy to a most remarkable extent. What is known of the behavior of European Jews during those days, for example, despite the claims of some individual authors and the indubitable fact that there were all sorts of rumors current, shows that the Jews were not conscious of any extermination program. When they were told to pack up for transport, they did just that, and went without resistance. In Chapter IV we shall note Theresienstadt Jews volunteering for transport to Auschwitz as late as August 1944, for the Jews at Theresienstadt knew nothing of any extermination program at Auschwitz or anywhere else. In Chapter VII we shall note that the Nazis were allegedly even unwilling to commit anything to confidential documents for, we are told, &quot;the drafting of circumspect minutes was one of the major arts of Hitler's Reich.&quot; Since this is the case put forward by the extermination mythologists, then it is not merely that occurrences of the sort of remarks under consideration do not support their case; the problem becomes that of explaining such occurrences, and it's their problem.
		</p>
		<p>
			(c) The Goebbels remark should be seen for what it was: a professional propagandist's reaction to the Allied bombings, which obsessed German policy in various ways from May 1940 on. Since the facts in this connection, although well established, are not well known, they are very briefly summarized here but, in order to avoid inexcusably long digression, the summary is indeed brief. The reader interested in more thorough treatment is referred to Veale and to Colby.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the outbreak of war in 1939, German air doctrine viewed the bomber as a form of artillery and thus a weapon to be used in support of ordinary ground operations. It was in this connection that the well publicized bombings of Warsaw in 1939 and Rotterdam in May 1940 took place only after these cities had actually become the scenes of military operations and the laws of siege applied. &quot;Strategic bombing,&quot; as we understand the term, played no role in German combat operations (although of course it had been and was under study by German military planners).
		</p>
		<p>
			This was not the case in Britain, however, for at the time that the Germans were using their bombers as artillery in the Netherlands, the British made the &quot;splendid decision&quot; to bomb German civilian targets, knowing perfectly well that Hitler had no intention or wish to engage in warfare of this sort (Hitler, indeed, did not want war with Britain at all). There was a moderate amount of German bombing of targets in England during the early summer of 1940, but only specifically military targets were attacked, even while such cities as Hamburg and Bremen were undergoing general attack. It was only after three months of this, and with the greatest reluctance, that Hitler felt himself forced to reply in kind, and in this way the well publicized &quot;Blitz&quot; hoax was established. The British people were not permitted to find out that their Government could have stopped the German raids at any time merely by stopping the raids on Germany.
		</p>
		<p>
			The British raids on Germany, while of no military significance in 1940, had put the German Government on the spot in German popular opinion, since the German people naturally thought that their Government should be able to do something about them, and this was the only reason that the Germans had adopted retaliatory bombing as a last resort. In announcing the policy, Hitler declared in a Sportpalast speech of September 4, 1940, that: / 29
		</p>
		<p class="Indented">
			If the British Air force drops two or three or four thousand kilograms of bombs, we will drop a hundred and fifty, a hundred and eighty, two hundred thousand, thee hundred thousand, four hundred thousand kilograms and more in a single night.
		</p>
		<p>
			This was a gross exaggeration of his capabilities relative to the British for, although at the time his bombers were numerically superior to the British, they were designed for support of troops and not for the &quot;strategic bombing&quot; that the British bombers were equipped for. Nevertheless violent words are cheap and, after the Luftwaffe, which was never more than a nuisance for the Allied bombing operations, violent words (sometimes coupled with promises of secret new weapons) were about all Hitler and Goebbels were able to come up with, in 1940 or at any subsequent time, to oppose the bombings. It is in this context that the Goebbels remark should be grasped.
		</p>
		<p>
			(d) There were bloodthirsty remarks made on both sides during the war. In the U.S. there were many examples of wild views earnestly put forward by apparently civilized persons, which were received with apparently thoughtful reactions of approval by equally respected persons. Since there were so many such people, it will suffice to remark only on Clifton Fadiman, the well known author and critic who, at the time, was the book review editor of the New Yorker weekly magazine.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fadiman was the principal luminary of the Writers War Board, a semi-official government agency that did volunteer writing for government agencies in connection with the war. The Board was chaired by Rex Stout. The thesis that Fadiman and Stout carried to the writers&rsquo; community in 1942 was that writings on the war should seek &quot;to generate an active hate against all Germans and not merely against Nazi leaders.&quot; This generated some heated controversy and writers and observers took sides in what became debate hot enough for Fadiman to declare that he knows of &quot;only one way to make a German understand and that's to kill them and even then I think they don't understand.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			These were not isolated outbursts for, through his column in the New Yorker, Fadiman welcomed the opportunity to set down his views on Germans in a more organized context. In April 1942 he had found the juvenile concept he needed in a book by de Sales, The Making of Tomorrow. Taking for granted the reader's concurrence that the Nazis were at least the worst scourge to come along in centuries, he wrote that de Sales&rsquo;
		</p>
		<p class="Indented">
			argument is simply that the present Nazi onslaught is not in the least the evil handiwork of a group of gangsters but rather the final and perfect expression of the most profound instincts of the German people. &quot;Hitler is the incarnation of forces greater than himself. The heresy he preaches is two thousand years old.&quot; What is the heresy? It is nothing more or less than a rebellion against Western civilization. Mr. de Sales traces five such German rebellions, beginning with Arminius. At first you are inclined to be skeptical of the author's grand indictment &mdash; his anti-Germanism may conceivably stem from his French ancestry &mdash; but as you follow his argument it becomes more and more cogent and the true proportions of this war emerge with great clarity.
		</p>
		<p>
			His reviews of books on the war expressed the historical concept that he had found in de Sales&rsquo; nonsense. Scoffing at Howard K. Smith's claim that &quot;If we can offer (the Germans) a real alternative to extermination, the nation, though it may not succumb to actual revolution, will fall into our hands,&quot; Fadiman wrote that &quot;The world had been appeasing the Germans ever since their human wolf pack broke out of their forest lairs in the time of Arminius. The result is a Europe on the verge of suicide.&quot; This was followed by his obvious approval of Hemingway's &quot;extraordinary &hellip; suggestion that &lsquo;the only ultimate settlement&rsquo; with the Nazis is to sterilize them. He means just that, in a surgical sense.&quot; Of course, Fadiman also saw no distinction between Nazis and other Germans and ridiculed Dorothy Thompson's &quot;passionate argument&quot; for such a distinction, as well as her conviction &quot;that our postwar efforts must be directed toward the construction of a European federation of states, with Germany, under democratic leadership, occupying a leading position.&quot; Although Fadiman never advocated the killing of all or most Germans, at least not in so many words, this was the clear sense of his declarations. After all, what else can be done with &quot;wolf packs who broke out of their forest lairs,&quot; are now trying to enslave the rest of the world, &quot;understand&quot; only if you &quot;kill them&quot; and must not be given &quot;a real alternative to extermination?&quot; / 30
		</p>
		<p>
			Clifton Fadiman was only a very prominent and semi-official example of a &quot;school of thought&quot; that existed among leaders of opinion in the U.S. during the war. James J. Martin and Benjamin Colby have published longer studies of Allied propaganda based on hatred of all Germans, the latter presenting a particularly thorough study of the Writers War Board.
		</p>
		<p>
			The climate of wartime opinion in Britain, of course, was about the same and, on account of England's earlier entry into the war, of longer standing. In reacting to Hitler's Berlin Sportpalast speech on the initiation of German air raids on British cities (quoted above), the London Daily Herald gloated that Hitler had made &quot;a frantic effort to reassure his raid-harassed people&quot; who &quot;are in an extremely nervous condition and stay awake even when there is no alarm.&quot; The same issue of the Herald goes on to present the recommendations of the Reverend C.W. Whipp, vicar of St. Augustine's Leicester:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="Indented">
				The order ought to be, &quot;wipe them out,&quot; and to this end I would concentrate all our science towards discovering a new and far more terrific explosive.
			</p>
			<p>
				These German devils (that is the only word one can use) come over our cities and turn their machine-guns on women and children.
			</p>
			<p>
				Well, all I hope is that the R.A.F. will grow stronger and stronger and go over and smash Germany to smithereens.
			</p>
			<p>
				A Minister of the Gospel, perhaps, ought not to indulge in sentiments like these.
			</p>
			<p>
				I go further, and I say quite frankly that if I could I would wipe Germany off the map.
			</p>
			<p>
				They are an evil race and have been a curse in Europe for centuries.
			</p>
			<p>
				There can be no peace until Hitler and all those who believe in him are sent to hell which is their place of origin and their final home.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			The Herald remarked that Whipp &quot;has aroused considerable local controversy,&quot; so it is evident that in Britain, as in the U.S., there were many people who kept their heads despite the Fadiman types.
		</p>
		<p>
			The peculiar ad hoc philosophy of history enunciated by de Sales and promoted by Clifton Fadiman also made its apparently independent appearance in England. An article by Reginald Hargreaves in the June 1941 issue of the respected journal National Review (not to be confused with the National Review that was founded in the U.S. in 1955) proposed as a war aim (as distinct from an unavoidable consequence of the war) that &quot;at least three million Nazi soldiers (be) put permanently out of action,&quot; it being
		</p>
		<p class="Indented">
			&hellip; an absolutely vital prerequisite to the laying down of arms that a sufficient number of the present-day corrupted, brutalized delirious young dervishes Nazidom should be left dead upon the field.
		</p>
		<p>
			The necessity for this arose from the consideration that
		</p>
		<p class="Indented">
			&hellip; throughout whole history Germany has shown herself as utterly uncivilized and worthy of nothing but detestation and disgust. From the very beginning the behavior of the Teutonic peoples had qualified them for the role of pariahs &mdash; the outcast mad dogs of Europe &hellip; <br>
			Our real war aim must be, not only military triumph in the filed, but the reduction of the German people to such a shrunken and delimited condition that never again will they be in such a position to &quot;start anything&quot; to the detriment of generations yet to come. Our conflict, despite much formations to the contrary, is with the German people; a race so savage, so predatory, so unscrupulous and so utterly uncivilized that their elimination as a major power is the only hope for a world that has no choice but to take the surgeon's knife and cut out this cankerous growth from its body-politic, thoroughly, relentlessly, once and for all.
		</p>
		<p>
			Such declarations seem even more extraordinary when one considers that they came from a nation noted for understatement.
		</p>
		<p>
			The point of this discussion is not that there had grown up any consensus in the U.S. and Britain that all Germans are by nature monsters and should be killed or at least sterilized. Everybody would agree that no such consensus existed (and even the extermination mythologists would agree, I think, that no consensus favoring extermination of the Jews existed in Germany). Moreover, as we all realize, the genocidal policies advocated or implied by many leaders of opinion in the U.S. and Britain were not, in their literal form, within the bounds of the possible; the American and British people would never have permitted such deeds to be done in their names. The point is that during the heat of wartime the most extraordinary things were said. For the most part (unfortunately, one can only say for the most part) such lunacies were not realized in events, but they were expressed nevertheless.
		</p>
		<p>
			Murderous things were said on both sides and, in my opinion and dim recollection of the times, the rhetoric in the U.S. (especially in regard to the Japanese) seems to me to have been more violent than anything that now seems to have been current in Germany during the war, although such a comparison is difficult and perhaps should not be attempted in regard to degree, on account of the very different roles played by &quot;public opinion&quot; and by the statements of political leaders in the two political systems involved.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the Axis side, one should also note that Fascist Italy had various anti-Jewish laws which were however very mild in application and certainly never approached murder. Nevertheless the anti-Jewish rhetoric in the Fascist press was at least as violent as anything generated in Germany and, assuming the New York Times (Oct. 22, 1944) reported accurately, it even advocated that all Italian Jews be &quot;annihilated as a danger to the international front&quot; since &quot;this is the moment to do away with half-way measures.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			(e) A final point is that one must use some common sense and a feeling for the contest in interpreting references to &quot;extermination&quot; and &quot;annihilation&quot; properly. In the American Civil War, many wanted Lincoln to &quot;annihilate&quot; the South, and it is not inaccurate English to say that Lincoln did just that, but it was understood, then as now, that the killing of all Southerners was not contemplated.
		</p>
		<p>
			Naturally the same observation may be made in connection with public declarations of Nazi leaders, but there is an additional point to be made in this connection. Very often the Jews were referred to via the German word das Judentum, one of whose correct translations is &quot;Jewry,&quot; but which can also mean &quot;Judaism&quot; or even &quot;Jewishness&quot; or &quot;the idea of Jewishness.&quot; Thus a Hitler reference to &quot;die Vernichtung des Judentums,&quot; if lifted out of context and interpreted in a purely literal way, can be interpreted as meaning the killing of all Jews, but it can also be interpreted as meaning the destruction of Jewish influence and power, which is what the politician Hitler actually meant by such a remark, although it is true that he could have chosen his words more carefully. Alfred Rosenberg made specific reference to this ambiguity in his IMT testimony, where he argued that &quot;die Ausrottung des Judetums,&quot; a term he had used on occasion, was not a reference to killing in the context in which Rosenberg had used it.
		</p>
		<p>
			The lengthy digression made necessary by Goebbels&rsquo; &quot;Ausrottung&quot; remark being concluded, we return to the survey of stories in the New York Times for 1942-1943.

		<p>
			No such &quot;slaughterhouse&quot; where executions were by &quot;firing squad&quot; is claimed today.

			Such vague statements of the wartime leaders, while devoid of any specific charges, carried more weight among the public than any of the more specific stories that the leaders may have seemed, by their statements, to be endorsing. We shall see that the specific claims of the time, at least for several months, did not very much resemble the claims made at the later trials. Nevertheless the politics of the situation, as perceived by Roosevelt and Churchill, made it opportune for them to &quot;go along,&quot; at least to the extent of making vague public statements supporting the propaganda.

			&quot;All hope for them had been abandoned,&quot; the spokesman said &hellip; <br>
			The spokesman said the Germans had launched a campaign to exterminate Jews from the protectorate and that of 40,000 Jews formerly in Prague only 15,000 remain. Pilsen and Bruenn have been cleared of Jews, he said, many of them being sent to Terezin, largest concentration camp in Nazi-controlled Europe. <br>

			The only truth in this story lies in the fact that the death rate of Jews was the &quot;privileged&quot; Jews &mdash; the war veterans &mdash; especially those with high decorations. There were other Jews, many of whom were eventually moved out but, if they suffered, it was not at Theresienstadt. The place was visited by the Red Cross in June 1944 and the resulting favorable report angered the World Jewish Congress. / 31 There will be more to be said about Theresienstadt in subsequent chapters.

				Sept. 5, p. 3: U.S. REBUKES VICHY ON DEPORTING JEWS.
			</p>
			<p>
				WASHINGTON, Sept. 4 &mdash; The State Department has made the &quot;most vigorous representations possible&quot; to the French Government through the American Embassy in Vichy over the mass deportation of Jews from unoccupied France, it was announced today by the American Jewish Committee.
			</p>
			<p>
				The protest followed representations by four Jewish organizations, and the action was communicated to them in a letter by Sumner Welles, Under-Secretary of State &hellip; Mr. Welles said: &quot;I have received your communication of Aug. 27, 1942, enclosing a letter &hellip; in regard to the mass deportation of Jewish refugees from unoccupied France.
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;I am in complete agreement with the statements made concerning this tragic situation, which provides a new shock to the public opinion of the civilized world. It is deeply regretted that these measures should be taken in a country traditionally noted for adherence to the principles of equality, freedom and tolerance. <br>
				&quot;The American Embassy at Vichy &hellip; has made the most vigorous representations possible to the highest authorities at Vichy &hellip;&quot;
			</p>
			<p>
				&hellip; The letter of the four organizations to the Secretary of State follows: On behalf of the organizations we represent &hellip; the undersigned respectfully request our government to transmit to the government of France a solemn protest against the action taken recently by that government to turn thousands of refugees over to the agents of the Nazi government for deportation to Poland and to other Nazi-occupied regions in Eastern Europe.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reports reaching us &hellip; (state) that the government of France is permitting the &hellip; deportation by the Nazi of Jewish refugees who have been interned in a number of camps in the south of France. This action began about Aug. 8, when a total of 3,600 men, women and children were rounded up, loaded on trains and sent off without any word regarding their destination.
			</p>
			<p>
				The reports agree that these 3,600 were the first contingent of a total of 10,000 Jewish refugees which the French government had agreed to deport to eastern territories &hellip;
			</p>
			<p>
				&hellip; Mass deportations of Jews from Germany and from territories under German occupation have been going on ever since the conquest of Poland. In accordance with the announced policy of the Nazis to exterminate the Jews of Europe, hundreds of thousands of these innocent men, women and children have been killed in brutal mass murders. The rest are being herded in ghettos in Eastern Europe under indescribably wretched conditions, as a result of which tens of thousands have succumbed to starvation and pestilence.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			We should only note at this point that even the four Jewish organizations are not completely secure in claiming exterminations, since they allow themselves an &quot;out&quot; by referring to those being &quot;herded in ghettos.&quot; Welles&rsquo; reply, while &quot;in complete agreement&rsquo; with the letter, avoids direct endorsement of the extermination claim.

			&hellip; The declaration was issued simultaneously through the State Department here, and in London &hellip; Text of Declaration: <br>
			&hellip; From all the occupied countries Jews are being transported in conditions of appalling horror and brutality to Eastern Europe. In Poland, which has been made the principle Nazi slaughterhouse, the ghettos established by the German invader are being systematically emptied of all Jews except a few highly skilled workers required for war industries. None of those taken away are ever heard of again. The able-bodied are slowly worked to death in labor camps. The infirm are left to die of exposure and starvation or are deliberately massacred in mass executions. The number of victims of these bloody cruelties is reckoned in many hundreds of thousands of entirely innocent men, women and children.
		</p>
		<p>
			This was the beginning of the State Department involvement in the extermination legend, and that it came from such a seemingly official source was the basis for special comment in the Times editorial of the same day:
		</p>
		<p class="Indented">
			Dec. 18, 1942, p. 26: HITLER'S TERROR <br>
			Despite all that has been written about Nazi persecution of the Jews, the facts in the joint statement issued yesterday in Washington, London and Moscow in the name of the United Nations will come as a shock to all civilized people who have preserved a modicum of human decency. For this statement is not an outcry of the victims themselves to which many thought it possible to close their ears on the ground that it might be a special plea, subject to doubt. It is the official statement of their own Governments, based on officially established facts &hellip;
		</p>
		<p>
			Clearly, it was believed that atrocity claims apparently coming from the State Department were more credible than claims coming from such groups as the World Jewish Congress, which is no doubt what is meant by the &quot;victims themselves.&quot; However we have seen that Wise was also behind the &quot;joint declaration.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			The December 17 statement marked the start of U.S. and British Government complicity in the extermination legend. The German Government did not see the event as laden with import, and von Stumm of the Foreign Offices&rsquo; press section flippantly explained to the neutral press that the Allied declaration was for the purpose of helping the Christmas sales of the Jewish department stores of New York and London. / 32

			Dec. 20, 1942, p. 23: ALLIES DESCRIBE OUTRAGES ON JEWS <br>
			What is happening to the 5,000,000 Jews of German-held Europe, all of whom face extermination, is described in a statement released yesterday by the United Nations Information Office &hellip; <br>
			&hellip; Novel methods of mass execution by shooting and lethal gas are cited in the main body of the report, which states that this destruction of the Jews is not &quot;isolated in one country but is continent-wide. Early in December 1942 the State Department in Washington gave some figures showing that the number of Jewish victims deported and perished since 1939 in Axis-controlled Europe now reached the appalling figure of 2,000,000 and that 5,000,000 were in danger of extermination &hellip; <br>
			The document concludes &hellip;&quot;The means employed in deporting from the ghetto all those who survive murders and shooting in the street exceeds all imagination. In particular, children, old people and those too weak for work are murdered. Actual data concerning the fate of the deportees is not at hand, but the news is available &mdash; irrefutable news &mdash; that places of execution have been organized at Chelmno and Belzec, where those who survive shootings are murdered en masse by means of electrocution and lethal gas.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			The alleged electrocutions at Belzec appeared a few times in the propaganda and will be mentioned again in Chapter V. They are one of the versions of exterminations that were quickly forgotten about after the end of the war. Nevertheless we can see, at this point, a clear tendency of the propaganda to resemble the claims which have become the fixed features of the legend, the gas chambers and the approximate 6,000,000 killed during the course of the war. We will have more to say a bit later on the origin of the six million figure.

			In mid-February, the Congress added, the Gestapo raided the Lyon headquarters of the General Union of French Jews, arrested the entire staff, removed them to the Drancy concentration camp and since has shipped them, too, to some &quot;extermination center&quot; on the other side of Europe.

		<p>
			Reitlinger (p. 327) tells us that &quot;less than a tenth of the Jews who were deported (from France) possessed French nationality.&quot; By his figures that is perhaps 5,000 of the 240,000 French Jews, suggesting that maybe the 5,000 enlisted for work voluntarily or were actually &quot;politicals&quot; or partisans.32

			April 25, 1943, p. 19: SCANT HOPE SEEN FOR AXIS VICTIMS. <br>
			Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES. <br>
			HAMILTON, Bermuda, April 24 &mdash; The large scale movement of refugees in impossible under wartime conditions, and neither the United States nor Great Britain, alone or jointly, can begin to solve the refugee problem. These two concrete impressions have emerged after almost a week's discussion of the refugee problem by the American and British delegations here.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since almost all Jews outside the Continent, particularly those in the U.S., believe the extermination claims, they brought political pressures which resulted in the Bermuda Conference. It was believed, / 33 correctly, that the Nazis wished the emigration of the Jews from Europe (under appropriated conditions) and this put the British and American Governments, on account of the propaganda basis for their war, into an awkward position which they were obliged to continually double-talk around. / 34 We have described the conflict between State and Treasury in this regard. The British had, at that point, no intention of opening Palestine, and both the British and Americans had no intention of providing the resources, in the middle of the war, for massive operations undertaken for reasons that were valid only to the degree that their propaganda was taken seriously. No sane modern statesmen believe their own propaganda. This is the dilemma which J. Breckenridge Long and other State Department officials felt themselves facing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another point that should be made here before proceeding with the survey of the propaganda is that, apparently, the six million figure had its origin in the propaganda of 1942-1943. An examination of the problem of the origin of the six million figure could easily lead to the conclusion that it had its origin at the IMT, where the indictment mentioned a figure (supplied by the World Jewish Congress) of 5,721,800 &quot;missing&quot; Jews and Wilhelm Hoettl of the SD signed an affidavit, 2738-PS, asserting that he had gotten a figure of six million from Eichmann. According to Hoettl, Eichmann had visited his Budapest office in a depressed mood because he was convinced that the war was lost, thought that the Allies would punish him as a major war criminal, and then declared, with no other witnesses present, that four million Jews had been killed in extermination camps and that two million had met death in various other ways, mainly through executions carried out by the Einsatzgruppen in Russia.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here we offer a different theory regarding the origin of the six million figure. Its very first appearance seems to be Rabbi Goldstein's statement of December 13, 1942, followed by the story of December 20 to the same effect, except that it specified a potential seven million in danger of being exterminated, rather than the six million implied by Goldstein's statement. However, it could correctly be argued that one must not infer the origin of the six million figure purely on the basis of these stories.
		</p>
		<p>
			However the appearances of the two million killed &mdash; four (or five) million to be killed &mdash; extermination claim, at the public affairs reported on March 2, and 10, 1943, must be taken much more seriously. More information about the latter affair can be extracted from an advertisement that also appeared on March 10 (p. 10), reporting that the show had been organized by the &quot;Committee for a Jewish Army of Stateless and Palestinian Jews,&quot; headed by Senator Johnson of Colorado. The advertisement makes the same extermination claim (two million killed, four million to be killed) and also lists the sponsors of the organization, which included many members of Congress and other notables. The same organization had also run a full page advertisement on February 16 (p. 11), specifying two million killed and four million to go (and also claiming that the only Arabs who objected to massive Jewish immigration into Palestine were Nazi agents). The two stories of April 20 suggest rather widespread usage of the two million killed &mdash; four (or five) million to be killed from the extermination claim in early 1943. We therefore have very general usage of the six (or seven) million figure, long before the end of the war, by the political establishment that wrote the charges at Nuremberg so, I believe, we can take late 1942 &mdash; early 1943 propaganda as the origin of the six million figure. The complete independence of that figure of any real facts whatever is reflected in Reitlinger's elaborate apologies for his belief that he can claim only 4.2 to 4.6 million Jews, almost all East European, who perished in Europe during World War II, one third of them dying from &quot;overwork, disease, hunger and neglect.&quot; / 35 However, Reitlinger figures are also mostly independent of any real facts, but that matter will be discussed in a later chapter.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is not at all remarkable that after the war somebody could be found to declare, at Nuremberg, that the propaganda figure was correct. Hoettl, indeed, was a completely appropriate choice, since he was one of those stereotype &quot;operators&quot; that the world of intelligence work is plagued with. Born in 1915, he entered the SD in 1938 and soon acquired a reputation for mixing official business with personal business deals. His teaming up with a Polish countess friend in a Polish land deal led, in 1942, to an SS investigation of his activities. The report of the investigation characterized him as &quot;dishonest, scheming, fawning &hellip; a real hoaxer,&quot; and concluded that he was not even suitable for membership in the SS, let alone a sensitive agency such as the SD. He was, accordingly, busted down to the ranks, but then the appointment in early 1943 of his fellow Austrian and Vienna acquaintance, Kaltenbrunner, to head the RSHA seems to have reversed his fortunes, and he rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel by the end of the war, and played a responsible role in foreign intelligence work. After the war he worked, until 1949, for the U.S. Army Counter-Intelligence Corps in lining up ex-SS personnel to give information. It is said that he managed to make this job rather lucrative. After 1949 he immersed himself in the snake pit of Vienna cold war politics, maintaining links with neo-Nazis, Soviet agents, and nearly everybody else. He had a particularly close relationship with one Soviet agent Kurt Ponger, a naturalized U.S. citizen whom he had met when Ponger was employed as a translator at the IMT (in addition a Kurt Ponger, probably the same person, was a prosecution lawyer in Case 4). Hoettl consequently became suspect in the Verber-Ponger espionage case of 1953, and was arrested by U.S. authorities in March in Vienna but released a few weeks later. In the mid-Fifties, he published two books on his wartime experiences. In 1961, he signed a prosecution affidavit for Eichmann's trial (substantially the same as his IMT affidavits). / 36
		</p>
		<p>
			Authors on my side have written that, during the war, Hoettl was an Allied agent. This is not correct. The only real fact that is involved in this claim is that Hoettl was in touch with Allen Dulles, of the OSS in Switzerland, towards the end of the war. This was a part of his duties: The RSHA was attempting to arrange a favorable conclusion of the hostilities and Hoettl was one of the persons involved in the secret contacts with the western Allies. No doubt, during the very last weeks of the war many of these intelligence officers started acting with their personal interests in mind and, also without doubt, Hoettl would have been delighted to have been enlisted as an Allied agent at this juncture of the war, and may even have volunteered some favors to Dulles with this development in mind. However, these contacts are not more evidence that Hoettl was an Allied agent than they are that Dulles was an Axis agent (Dulles is even said to have peppered his conversation with anti-Semitic remarks when he was trying to win the confidence of some German contacts / 37). If Hoettl had been a Allied agent, it would seem that he would boast about this in one of his two books (The Secret Front and Hitler's Paper Weapon), but he makes no such claim. In addition, Ian Colvin, who knows as much about these matters as anybody, wrote the Introduction for The Secret Front, and makes remarks in this connection.

			This was one of the very few pre-1944 specific reference to the Auschwitz concentration camp (although the stories of March 7, and April 27 were oblique references). The interesting thing about this reference to Auschwitz is that it is essentially correct, as shall be confirmed in the next chapter, although one cannot be confident of the accuracy of the 58,000 figure and &quot;torture&quot; and &quot;executions&quot; should not be included as causes of the high death rate. The important point is that this story implicitly rejects the post-war extermination claims which asserts that thousands were killed at Auschwitz almost every day, starting at the latest in the summer of 1942 and continuing to the autumn of 1944.

			This completes the survey of relevant New York Times stories for the period of spring 1942 through 1943. Selectivity on my part was, of course, necessary but I believe that an adequate picture has been given of the sort of stories that were in circulation in supposedly intelligent circles.
		</p>
		<p>
			What cannot be recaptured is the hysterical atmosphere of the time. The unusually critical reader will have noticed the rather high page number of many of the stories cited, especially those which report specific instances of mass killings. In practical politics only page one counts, and these things seldom appeared on page one. If Roosevelt said something, it was normally printed on page one, but only because he said it, not because he said anything interesting or significant. The allegations of exterminations of Jews do not appear to have had great importance to the public during the war, if one judged from the lack of any prominence given to such stories. Another way to express it is to say that if one spends some time examining the newspapers of the time, a high degree of hostility to the Nazis is obvious, but the specific basis of the hostility is virtually impossible to distinguish. Thus, there is something of an emotional nature missing from our survey, but this is unavoidable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Two principal observations should be made in regard to the extermination propaganda. First, the legend has its origin among Zionists and, second, Auschwitz was not claimed as an extermination camp until very late in the war.
		</p>
		<p>
			We have seen that the first extermination claims were not based on one scrap of intelligence data. Zionists, principally the World Jewish Congress, merely presented their nonsense to the Allied governments, in particular to the U.S. Government, demanding endorsement of their nonsense. The first reactions in Washington were to scoff at the claims but, on account of various political pressures, and only on account of those pressures and not because corroborating information had been procured from military intelligence, official Washington eventually cooperated with the extermination propaganda to the extent of having high officials make vague public declarations in support of it, and of having propaganda agencies make more specific declarations of an obscure nature. The early propaganda had features which are retained in the legend to this day, such as the six million figure, and also features which were quickly forgotten, such as the soap factories, although both features were authored by the same Zionist circles.

		<p>
			In regard to our terminology, it should be remarked that the world &quot;Zionist&quot; is not being employed here as a code word for &quot;Jewish;&quot; the evidence shows that, while the hoax is certainly a Jewish hoax, in the sense of having been invented by Jews, it is also a Zionist hoax, in the sense of having been invented by Jews who were Zionists, on behalf of Zionist ends. The Zionist character of the propaganda is quite clear; not that, as a rule, the persons who were pressing for measures to remove Jews from Europe (under the circumstances a routine and understandable proposal) coupled such proposals with demands that such Jews be resettled in Palestine, which shows that there was much more in the minds of the Zionist propagandists than mere assistance to refugees and victims of persecution.
		</p>
		<p>
			We have also noted that Auschwitz was absent from the extermination propaganda in 1942 and 1943 although, if there had been exterminations at such a prominent site, military intelligence and others would certainly have learned of it. To be sure, Auschwitz appeared in the propaganda, but the specific claims, bearing on a high death rate due to more or less normal causes, were in their essentials true, however amplified their content. There were no claims of gas chambers or exterminations. Naturally I make the reservation that this statement is based on the fact that, after a reasonable thorough study, I have not noted Auschwitz in the 1942-1943 extermination propaganda; Treblinka, Belzec and Chelmno appeared in the newspaper extermination stories, but no Auschwitz.
		</p>
		<p>
			This view is confirmed by the periodicals and books of the period that I have examined. Three periodical publications are of particular interest. The issue of Commonweal for June 4, 1943 carried an article by Jacques Maritain which summarized what he, evidently after some investigation, believed to be the chief features of the extermination program. Auschwitz is not mentioned, although exterminations via &quot;poison gases, electrocution, mass piling into enclosed spaces where asphyxia takes place by degrees, suffocation &hellip; in sealed freight cars&quot; are mentioned, and particular reference is made to Chelmno.
		</p>
		<p>
			The New Republic for August 30, 1943 was a special issue devoted to the plight of the Jews in Europe, and made no reference to Auschwitz. A two page advertisement, placed by the Jewish Labor Committee (New York), mentions only Treblinka, Belzec and &quot;hermetically sealed cars where Jews are being poisoned.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			Survey Graphic for April 1943 carries a two page article by William L. Shirer. The subject is the whole range of alleged German atrocities and thus Auschwitz (Oswie&ccedil;im) is mentioned, but only in connection with an alleged high death rate of 250 Poles per day, due to &quot;executions, inhuman treatment, hunger and epidemics.&quot; Shirer claims exterminations of Jews at Belzec.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Shirer story cites a March 7 report from the Polish government in London as the source for the statements about Auschwitz. This is the earliest reference that I know of to Auschwitz in the propaganda. The only candidate for an earlier claim that I know of appears in The Black Book of Polish Jewry, J. Apenszlak, ed., 1943. Pages 56 and 59 tell of reports in the &quot;East London Observer&quot; in early 1942 that the ashes of Jews who had been sent to Auschwitz were being returned to their relatives (contradicting post-war propaganda). However, as far as I have been able to determine, the East London Observer did not exist. The Black Book does not claim exterminations at Auschwitz but speaks of exterminations via gasmobile at Chelmno (pp. 115-117, in agrement with later claims), via electrocution in baths at Belzec followed by burial (p. 131, not in agreement), through being left in freight cars for days near Belzec followed by burning (pp. 137-138, no in agreement); the Diesel engine whose exhaust gases were used for killing in later versions of the story is used for digging the graves in The Black Book).
		</p>
		<p>
			There remains one source which conveys the impression that Auschwitz appeared in the extermination propaganda early in 1943 or even earlier. This is the book The Devil's Chemists by Josiah DuBois, whom we have encountered as a wartime Treasury official. At the NMT after the war, DuBois was the chief prosecutor in the Farben trial, and his book is his account of the trial and such other matters that he considered relevant. According to him, a message dealing with Auschwitz crossed his desk in November 1942. The message transmitted the contents of a note, a &quot;crumpled testament of despair,&quot; which had allegedly been written by a worker-inmate at Auschwitz and them passed along underground in hand-to-hand relay to Bern:
		</p>
		<p class="Indented">
			We worked in the huge &quot;Buna&quot; plant &hellip; There was a chain of sentry posts overlooking every 10 square meters of workers, and whoever stepped outside was shot without warning as &quot;having attempted to escape.&quot; But attempts were made every day, even by some who tried to crawl past the sentries because they could no longer walk.
		</p>
		<p>
			The note also applied to Farben's Ter Meer &quot;stereotyped images of swastika and riding crop and fixed sneer (which had not characterized Ter Meer at any time during his life).&quot; The claimed origin and history of the note make the whole appear rather silly but one should note the strong element of fact in the note; at approximately this time any workers at Auschwitz were indeed not in a condition to work or even walk. Thus this message was not really extermination propaganda, and we cannot be certain that it really existed but, if it did, all it suggests is that the propagandists were well aware, in late 1942, of what was happening at Auschwitz.
		</p>
		<p>
			DuBois then proceeds to misinform his reader that the two messages of January and April 1943 from Harrison to the State Department, discussed above, dealt with Auschwitz, i.e. it was at Auschwitz that 6,000 were allegedly being killed every day. In reporting this, DuBois is simply passing along misinformation. His motive seems to be that, as the prosecutor in the Farben case, he was attempting to maximize the significance of Auschwitz in every respect possible, and has thus read in the record something that simply is not there.<a class="footnote">105</a>

		<h3>
			German Reactions
		</h3>
		<p>
			It is of passing interest to comment on what the Germans were saying about the Allied propaganda stories. We have seen that von Stumm of the press section of the German Foreign Office ridiculed the extermination claim when it was first made by the Allied governments, but that was a rare reference, on the part of the German Government, to any specific Allied propaganda concoction. The weekly newspaper Das Reich, published by the Goebbels Ministry, and the Voelkischer Berbachter, the daily newspaper of the Nazi Party, had much comment of a general sort on the &quot;Greuelpropaganda,&quot; but there were few references to specific propaganda claims. The usual situation was one of no commentary on the Jewish extermination claim, as well as on other specific propaganda claims, e.g. starvation and torturing of American and British POW's and the various gruesome inventions of Hollywood, such as the draining of the blood of children in occupied countries for the use of the Wehrmacht.
		</p>
		<p>
			The reason for this relative silence on specific propaganda claims was no doubt that there was no need, from the German point of view, to review its content. They had seen it all before, during World War I. Thus the German press treatment of the &quot;Greuelpropaganda&quot; was on a higher level and, rather than concern itself with the specific contents of the stories, it concerned itself with such questions as the nature of the political interests that were served by the propaganda and the extent and means of Jewish influence in the Allied press (e.g. Das Reich for December 20, 1942).
		</p>
		<h3>
			The War Refugee Board Report: Birth of the Auschwitz Legend
		</h3>
		<p>
			The high level Washington commitment to the claim that Auschwitz was an extermination camp came in November 1944, after the claimed termination of the killing program, in the form of the WRB report (the claim had appeared many times in the propaganda earlier in 1944: those stories are reviewed in a later chapter). The issuing of the report was carried by the New York Times on November 26, 1944 (p. 1) and some excerpts were given.
		</p>
		<p>
			The WRB report is described as two reports, one written by &quot;two young Slovakian Jews&quot; and the other by &quot;a Polish major,&quot; all of whom had been inmates at Auschwitz from the spring of 1942 until the spring of 1944, when they escaped (the two Jews on April 7). There is an additional short supplement said to be written by two other young Jews who escaped on May 27, 1944 and made their way to Slovakia (under German domination until 1945) to make their report, which is said to have been received in Switzerland on August 6, 1944. The authors are completely anonymous and this anonymity is duly apologized for &quot;whose names will not be disclosed for the time being in the interest of their own safety.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			Sections 1, 2 and 3 constitute the first part of the report, and section 4 the second part. The first section is the major part of the report. It is said to have been written by a Slovakian Jew who arrived at Auschwitz on April 13, 1942 and was given a registration number (tattooed onto his left breast) in the neighborhood of 29,000. He eventually became registrar in the Birkenau infirmary. The feature of this first section is a detailed record, for the period April 1942 to April 1944, of the transports which arrived at Auschwitz, together with the registration numbers assigned. About 55 groups of transports (sometimes more than one transport are in a group) are reported and the (admittedly approximate) registration numbers assigned to the people in each group are given. The numbers start at 27,400 and run to 189,000 in the consecutive numbering system in which a number was not used twice. For each group the nationalities represented, as well as other information (Jewish or Aryan, political prisoners or other, occasional names of individuals, numbers &quot;gassed&quot; instead of registered, etc.) is given. The WRB report, if it is either never having existed or having been sent on to another destination), is one of the two known sources of significant amounts of such information (the other is the referenced set of Netherlands Red Cross reports, which is the subject of Appendix C).
		</p>
		<p>
			Almost all of this information is given by the author of the first section of the WRB report, but after he escaped the authors of the third, supplemental, section of the report kept an account of this information for the period April 7 &mdash; May 27 and have contributed it to the report.
		</p>
		<p>
			The second section of the report is said to be written by a Slovakian Jew who arrived at the Lublin camp around June 4, 1942, but was sent to Auschwitz around June 30, 1942. According to the first section of the report he then would have received a registration number around 44,000, which was tattooed onto his left forearm (the tattooing system had changed). The two authors of the first two sections of the report are the two young Slovakian Jews who escaped together on April 7, 1944. The third section of the report is the short supplement and the fourth section is the contribution of the &quot;Polish major.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			The anonymity of the authors of the report is certainly a vulnerable feature, but the major implausibility is simply the contents of the WRB report. Examination shows than the information given in the report which is most likely true to semi-true is the sort of thing that could have been built up from intelligence data, not from reports of &quot;two young Slovakian Jews and a Polish major&quot; who &quot;escaped.&quot; This is exactly as one should expect; Germany's enemies had certain means of gathering information about German camps and about events in Europe and simply used information gathered by such conventional methods, plus a considerable amount of intervention, to compose the WRB report. It is just not believable that they were in such a primitive position with respect to, of all things, the industrial center Auschwitz, that they were obliged to depend for information on miraculous escapes by unusually well informed prisoners. This point will be amplified below. Of course, such an observation does not rule out the possible use of reports of former employees or inmates, escaped or otherwise, as part of the data.
		</p>
		<p>
			The report presents the following information (of estimates, or guesses, or claims, or inventions):
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li> The number of prisoners at Auschwitz I in the month of April 1942, the predominant nationalities present and the main causes of interment. Description of the inmate registration number system and the &quot;star system&quot; of inmate insignia. A list of various factories in the area (pt. I, 1-2). </li>
			<li> An accurate map of the area, comparable to our Fig. 5 (pt. I, 4). </li>
			<li> Dimensions related to the Auschwitz I camp size, its fences and its guard towers. Ditto for Birkenau. Description of barracks (pt. I, 5-7). </li>
			<li> In the case of a natural death of a prisoner, a death certificate was made out and sent to Oranienburg central camp administration. If the inmate was gassed, his name was entered in a special register and marked &quot;S.B.&quot; (Sonderbehandlung, special treatment) (pt. I, 9). </li>
			<li> Four buildings, referred to as Crematoria I, II, III and IV were in use in Spring 1944 at Birkenau; use of at least one of them had started in February 1943. Each building contained: (A) a furnace room of ovens; (B) a large hall; (C) a gas chamber. The first two buildings each contained 36 ovens and the other two 18 each. Three bodies are put in one oven at a time and the burning took an hour and half. Thus one could dispose of 6,000 bodies per day. This was considered, at the time, an improvement over burning in trenches (the method previously employed) (pt. I, 14-15). </li>
			<li> The specific product used for generating the gas for the gas chamber was a powder called &quot;Cyklon,&quot; manufactured by a Hamburg concern. When exposed it released cyanide gas and about three minutes were required to kill everybody in the gas chamber. The containers for the Cyklon were marked &quot;for use against vermin&quot; (pt. I, 16). </li>
			<li> Prominent people from Berlin attended the inauguration of the first crematorium in March 1943. The &quot;program&quot; consisted in the gassing and burning of 8,000 Cracow Jews. The guests (no names given) were extremely satisfied with the results (pt. I, 16). </li>
			<li> A detailed breakdown of the numbers and classifications of the inmates at Birkenau in April 1944 (pt. I, 23-24) </li>
			<li> In the camp, each block has a &quot;block eldest&quot; who &quot;has power of life and death.&quot; Until February 1944 nearly 50 per cent of the block eldests were Jews, but this was stopped by order of Berlin. Under the block eldest is the block recorder, who does all the clerical work. If the recorder has noted down a death by mistake, as often occurs, the discrepancy is corrected by killing the bearer of the corresponding number. Corrections are not admitted (pt. I, 25). </li>
			<li> A passage strikingly similar to the November 1942 &quot;crumpled testament of despair&quot;: &quot;We worked in the huge buna plant to which we were herded every morning about 3 A.M. &hellip; As our working place was situated outside the large chain of sentry posts, it was divided into small sectors of 10 x 10 meters, each guarded by an SS man. Whoever stepped outside these squares during working hours was immediately shot without warning for having &lsquo;attempted to escape.'&hellip; Very few could bear the strain and although escape seemed hopeless, attempts were made every day.&quot; (pt. I, 30). </li>
			<li> A &quot;careful estimate of the numbers of Jews gassed in Birkenau between April 1942 and April 1944,&quot; summarized in a tabular form. The number showed up in the published record of the IMT trial and are presented here as Fig. 25 (pt. I, 33). </li>
			<li> Great excitement prevailed as a consequence of the escape of the two young Slovakian Jews (this is supposedly written by the authors of the supplementary section 3), and the friends and superiors of the two escapees were closely questioned. Since the two had held posts as &quot;block recorders,&quot; all Jews exercising such functions were removed for punishment and as a precautionary measure. This, of course, contradicts the implication of the &quot;Foreword&quot; of the WRB report that the Germans did not know the identity or even registration numbers of the two escapees, since it withholds such information &quot;in the interest of their own safety&quot; (pt. I, 34). </li>
			<li> Starting May 15, 1944 Hungarian Jews started arriving at Birkenau at the rate of about 15,000 per day. Ninety per cent were killed immediately and, since this exceeded the capacity of the ovens, the method of burning in trenches which had existed earlier was reverted to. The ten per cent who were not killed were also not registered at Birkenau but sent eventually to camps in Germany: Buchenwald, Mauthausen, Gross-Rosen, Gusen, Flossenburg, Sachsenhausen, etc. (pt. I, 36-37). </li>
			<li> A new inmate registration number system was also put into effect in the middle of May 1944. At about the same time, a visit by Himmler to nearby Cracow was reported in the Silesian newspapers. These newspaper reports apparently omitted to mention, however, that on this trip Himmler had also visited Birkenau, and that his party made a special visit to Crematorium I (pt. I, 37-38). </li>
			<li> In the late summer of 1943 a commission of four distinguished Dutch Jews had visited Auschwitz for the purpose of inspecting the condition of the Dutch Jews (who were then specially prepared by the Germans with new clothes, better food, etc.). The commission saw only a part of the Dutch Jews sent to Auschwitz but were told that the others were in similar camps. The commission was satisfied with this and signed a declaration that everything had been found in good order at Auschwitz, but after signing the four Jews &quot;expressed a desire to see the camp of Birkenau and particularly the crematoria about which they had heard some stories &hellip; The commission was then taken to Birkenau &hellip; and immediately to crematorium No. 1. Here they were shot from behind. A telegram was supposedly sent to Holland reporting that after leaving Auschwitz the four men had been victims of an unfortunate automobile accident.&quot; (pt. I, 38). </li>
			<li> The area around Auschwitz, within a radius of 100 kilometers, had been evacuated, and the buildings not to be taken over by the camp were to be demolished (pt. II, 6). </li>
			<li> Description of the Auschwitz I hospital and its procedures. In the autumn of 1942 the hospital mortality rate was so high that Berlin requested an explanation. An investigation uncovered that the &quot;camp doctor&quot; had been administering lethal injections to weak and sick people, certain prisoners condemned to death, and some teenagers considered to be orphans. For &quot;punishment&quot; the camp doctor was simply sent to the same job at the Buna plant (probably meaning Monowitz) the SS continued to provide some services to the camp administered by Farben) (pt. II, 8-10). </li>
			<li> As a result of bad treatment a Jew, irrespective of his physical condition, could not last more than two weeks (pt. II, 12). </li>
			<li> In the summer of 1942 Jews were being gassed in the birch forest (Birkenwald, where Birkenau was located) in special sealed buildings giving the impression of showers. Since the crematoria were not completed, the bodies were buried in mass graves, causing putrefaction. In the autumn of 1942 the four crematoria were completed and many bodies were exhumed and burned (this is the Polish major's account, contradicting that of the two young Slovakian Jews, who said that part of the new crematoria were put into operation in February 1943 and the prior to that date bodies were burned in trenches) (pt. II, 16-17). </li>
			<li> Details on how it was decided exactly when to execute somebody already condemned to death (pt. II, 16-17). </li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The foregoing is effectively illustrative of the contents of the WRB report. It is a mixture of truth, guess-work, and invention, the factual part of which could have been, and obviously was, put together on the basis of inside information available in 1944.
		</p>
		<p>
			The contradiction in the two accounts of exterminations serves to enhance the credibility of the claim that these are unsolicited reports of escaped inmates, but it is not clear that such increased credibility was the motivation for composing the report thus. The first version, that large crematoria were in operation at Birkenau in early 1943 and that mass cremations took place in trenches before that date, is the one subsequently put forward (and the correct one in regard to the date of availability of the crematoria) but the second version of mass graves might have some truth in it also, since there had been a typhus epidemic in the summer, at a time when inadequate crematoria facilities existed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Reitlinger uses the WRB report as a source. This is not entirely justified but, it is not entirely without justification either. One must assume that much of the material in the report is true. As will be elaborated below, there is no question of the competence of the authors of the report. However one must be careful in this regard, obviously, and accept only that which seems corroborated by either common sense or independent evidence. Given the protagonistic and propagandistic role of the report, but recalling that a well organized hoax necessarily contains much valid fact, this is perfectly reasonable.
		</p>
		<p>
			One can be rather specific about the routes by which information flowed out of the camps. In cases where there was significant industrial activity, the inmates inevitably came into contact with many people who were not camp inmates (company employees, railroad employees, etc.) and these contacts were the basis for an extensive system of clandestine channels of communication. Auschwitz, of course, furnished numerous and excellent opportunities for such contacts and, on account of the communist organization, there were very effective channels to outside underground centers, especially in nearby Cracow. Information about the camp, including, it is claimed, copies of orders received from Berlin or Oranienburg, flowed constantly out of Auschwitz. These channels were also used to send such things as money, medicine and forged papers into the camp. In addition, as discussed in another connection in the next chapter, the Communists in all of the camps were highly organized for illegal radio listening. If they had receivers, they no doubt also had transmitters. There has been witness testimony to possession of radio transmitters by camp inmates, and Reitlinger believes that Auschwitz inmates had transmitters. / 41
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to grasp completely the nature of the information and propaganda channels that existed, one should take special note of the War Refugee Board and the OSS. The WRB maintained constant contact with events in Hungary even after the German occupation in March 1944. For example, it had its agent, Raoul Wallenberg, in the Swedish diplomatic corps. And there were other links through Jewish organizations. Jewish leaders in Budapest were in constant contact with those in Slovakia, and the Slovakian Jewish leadership was in contact with Polish Jewry, particularly in Cracow. / 42
		</p>
		<p>
			Possibly more important than the WRB, although its role in the hoax is not nearly as obvious, was the Office of Strategic Services, OSS, the predecessor of the CIA. The OSS was set up early in World War II under the leadership of General William Donovan. its mission was intelligence of a political nature and related matters (e.g. sabotage, propaganda, guerilla warfare) as distinct from the more conventional forms of military intelligence, to which it operations were related somewhat as the operations of the German SD were related to those of the Abwehr, although high placed Washington observers complained that the OSS seemed to enjoy unlimited funds and knew no bounds on its authority.
		</p>
		<p>
			With only a few exceptions, the OSS was not staffed by military people but by persons recruited from private life. Thus it included many political types, ranging from Communists to emigr&eacute; monarchists. On account of their organization, the Communists were naturally a significant force in the OSS, irrespective of their numbers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The OSS was deeply involved with propaganda. The OWI (Office of War Information), the most prominent U.S. wartime propaganda agency, had been a 1942 split off from the OSS. It had been the propaganda division of the &quot;Office of the Coordinator of Information&quot; (Donovan) when it split off, and the remainder of Donovan's organization was renamed the OSS. Despite this separation, the OSS remained active in the propaganda field, and when the Anglo-American PWB (Psychological Warfare Branch) was set up in Eisenhower's headquarters, it drew its American personnel from both the OWI and the OSS.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another propaganda operation of the OSS, one of which employed a large number of &quot;progressive writers,&quot; was the MO (Morale Operations Branch). The mission of MO was &quot;black propaganda,&quot; file. MO specialized in manufacturing propaganda presented in such a way that it would appear to have come from within the ranks of the enemy. MO thus distributed forged newspapers and military orders among enemy personnel, operated clandestine transmitters that purported to be broadcasting from within enemy territory, and started rumors in the Axis and Axis occupied countries. Its staff included &quot;liberals and communists alike, all dedicated to the idealist interpretation of the fight against fascism.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			A particularly relevant facet of the OSS operations was that they had enlisted the cooperation of the Jewish Agency in Palestine (which was really the unofficial Israeli government of the time). The Jewish Agency, on account of extensive and elaborate contacts with Jews in Europe, especially in the Balkans, was able to undertake many important missions for the OSS. Thus the channels to Jews in Hungary, Slovakia and beyond were open.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, it is of interest that the OSS was very significant on the prosecution staff at the IMT trial, especially in the early stages / 43
		</p>
		<p>
			The point to be made in this discussion of the WRB report is certainly not that it was invented in the OSS or the WRB. I do not know the identity of the authors and do not believe that the question is of great significance. The main point is that two &quot;internationals,&quot; the Communist and the Zionist, played important roles in the intelligence, propaganda and refugee assistance programs of the U.S. The WRB, effectively taking its orders from Harry Dexter White, Henry Morgenthau Jr. and the World Jewish Congress and other Zionists, and the OSS, with its staff of Communists and its Jewish Agency allies, show that the situation was perfectly suitable for the manufacture of a Jewish extermination propaganda lie, built about Auschwitz, which, as a precaution, contained enough real facts to suggest to the unreflective that the allegations were true.
		</p>
		<p>
			The interior of the Auschwitz camp was not, by any exercise of the imagination, isolated from the Allies. The World's most efficient intelligence organization, the Communist Party, could transmit any information desired to any destination whatever, and the situation was such that the ubiquitous Zionist International was in a position to manufacture and transmit whatever items seemed appropriate for the occasion. Even it the contents of the WRB report were entirely true, and escape by inmates would not have been at all necessary to get the &quot;facts&quot; into the hands of the Allies. Note that we are told that the entire contents of the WRB report are due to three independent escapes by remarkably informed inmates. In view of what we know about the channels of communication that existed, this is silly in the extreme.
		</p>
		<p>
			The authors of the WRB report remained anonymous for quite a bit more than &quot;the time being.&quot; The report became a prosecution document at Nuremberg under the number 022-L. The descriptive material accompanying the document, dated August 7, 1945 (the &quot;staff evidence analysis&quot;), seems distressed at the anonymity of the authors. It tells of a certain Dr. Joseph Elias, &quot;Protestant Pastor of Jewish ancestry, organizer of Jewish resistance in Hungary, head of Jo'Pasztor Bizottsag, who interrogated the first two Slovak Jews after their escape.&quot; Then it tells of &quot;Dr. G. Soos &mdash; Secretary of Hungarian underground movement MFM, who brought the first report (of the first two Slovak Jews) to Italy.&quot; The organization &quot;Jo'Pasztor&quot; was real, but of activities of Elias or Soos in connection without these matters nothing, it seems, is known. Of the origins of the parts of the report attributed to the other three people we are told nothing. It is said that R.D. McClelland, Bern representative of the WRB, forwarded the report to Washington in early July 1944 (the supplemental part was presumably not included).
		</p>
		<p>
			The WRB report was put into evidence at the IMT, as document 022-L, by Major Walsh on December 14, 1945. / 44 There was no defense objection, at the IMT, to the acceptance of the report into evidence. At the Farben trial the prosecution submitted the report (Document Book 89) as evidence but the defense objected and this objection &quot;as to the competence and materiality of each and every document in the book&quot; was sustained by that court. The result of the ensuing legal argument was that the court agreed to taking a certain very ambiguous &quot;judicial notice&quot; of the documents. / 45
		</p>
		<p>
			Anonymity was maintained for several more years, since the first edition (1953) of Reitlinger's The Final Solution considers the authors anonymous. In considering the beginnings of the gassings, reference is made to &quot;the very reliable report of the Birkenau infirmary registrar of Blockschreiber, who escaped to Hungary in April 1944&quot; (p. 110). In connection with information about Theresienstadt Jews transported to Auschwitz &quot;we are indebted to a Slovak Jewish doctor, who escaped to Hungary in April, 1944. This man, who was in charge of the Birkenau infirmary records &hellip;&quot; (pp. 169-170). In discussing the WRB report, Reitlinger told us that &quot;the most important document is that of the anonymous Slovak Jewish doctor who escaped to Hungary in April 1944&quot; (p. 540). In all three cases Reitlinger was referring to the author of the first section of the WRB report, who, the report says, was the Slovakian Jew who arrived on April 13, 1942 and was given a registration number around 29,000. Reitlinger refers to him as a doctor, but the report actually does not make it clear what he was; it appears that he was supposed to be an &quot;intellectual&quot; or a &quot;clerk.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			The next development seems to have been the publication in 1956 in Israel of the book Im Schatten des Todes, by J. Oskar Neumann. Neumann had been one of the leaders of the various Jewish councils and resistance organizations in Slovakia. In his account Rabbi Michael Dov Ber Weissmandel (or Weissmandl), originally a Hungarian Jew resident in a part of Hungary that was annexed by Czechoslovakia after World War I, was the leader of Jewish resistance in Slovakia. In Neumann's story the two young Slovakian Jews appear on schedule in Slovakia, as does the Polish major (actually, the WRB report does not say where the Polish major escaped to). Neumann gives the impression that he actually met these people: &quot;Yet here sit eye-witnesses, who have told the whole truth.&quot; His account does not mention the two authors of the third, supplementary, section of the WRB report, and he does not tell us the names or tattooed registration numbers of the escapees. Since they were in great danger of being found by the Gestapo, which was looking for them, they &quot;were sent to an outlying mountainous area to rest.&quot; Rabbi Weissmandel communicated the report to Budapest, Switzerland, and other destinations, in order to warn other Jews, and to bring help.<a class="footnote">106</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Weissmandel emigrated to the United States after the war and set up an orthodox Talmudic seminary in New York State. He died in November 1957. However his war memoirs were published posthumously in 1960, unfortunately, in Hebrew, which I am not able to read. The WRB report is a major subject of his book. I have assumed that his story is essentially similar to Neumann's, since the two authors were similarly situated and had the same connections. However, I could be wrong.<a class="footnote">107</a>

			Rudolf Vrba
		</h3>
		<p>
			It appears that the next event involved Reitlinger. The anonymity of the authors of the WRB report is a striking and disturbing feature of the first edition of Reitlinger's book, as I am sure he realized. This no doubt bothered him, for it appears that he set out to locate the authors of the report, for he writes in his second edition, published in 1968, that Rudolf Vrba, the author of the &quot;most important&quot; part of the WRB report, i.e., the first section, was &quot;in hospital practice in Cardiff in 1960.&quot; Reitlinger's contact with Vrba in 1960, thus, would appear to be the first appearance of an alleged author of the report in any sort of historical record. Vrba was, apparently, produced as a consequence of Reitlinger's investigations. The town of Cardiff in south Wales is, incidentally, only about 150 miles from Reitlinger's home in Sussex. Reitlinger does not mention the name of any of the other authors. He considers a stencil book by Silberschein, Riegner's World Jewish Congress colleague in Switzerland, as including the &quot;complete version&quot; of the report.<a class="footnote">108</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Both authors of the first two sections of the WRB report (the first two young Slovakian Jews) acquired identities at Eichmann's trial in 1961. Two witnesses testified regarding the report, and it was offered in evidence with the explanation that the first two young Slovakian Jews were Alfred Wetzler (or Weczler) and Rudolf Vrba (ex Rosenberg or Rosenthal, then resident in England). The document was rejected on the grounds that certain contradictions in the figures offered required further explanation. Therefore, late in the trial, the prosecution produced an affidavit by Vrba. The affidavit explains how Vrba arrived at the impressively detailed figures regarding the transports to Auschwitz, which are the main feature of the WRB report. His affidavit gives the impression that, while he got assistance from various people, he was solely responsible for drawing up the figures, and he does not give the name of or even mention his companion who supposedly escaped with him in April 1944. He mentions a Philip Mueller, who helped him somewhat with his figures, because Mueller &quot;is apparently the only survivor alive at present.&quot; Vrba's affidavit was rejected by the court on the grounds that there was no excuse for the prosecution not bringing him to Jerusalem to testify. / 49
		</p>
		<p>
			Vrba appeared again at the Auschwitz trial in Frankfurt in 1964; his book, I Cannot Forgive, (with Alan Bestic), also appeared in 1964, shortly before his Frankfurt appearance. Vrba's companion in his supposed escape also appeared; Alfred Wetzler was said to have been the other young Slovakian Jew. Wetzler was (in 1964) a 46-year-old civil servant in Czechoslovakia, who had arrived at Auschwitz on April 13, 1942 and been given registration number 29,162. He had been a block registrar at Birkenau. Vrba was identified as a 40-year-old biochemist living in England, who had arrived at Auschwitz on June 30, 1942 and been given registration number 44,070. He had also been a block registrar at Birkenau. They had, they said, escaped on April 7, 1944 and made their way to Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, where they made their report to the Jewish elders and also to the Papal Nuncio. The report was smuggled to Budapest by Rabbi Weissmandel. / 50
		</p>
		<p>
			The 1964 story differs, therefore, from that which was told to the authors of the IMT staff evidence analysis in 1945. The most serious apparent contradiction, however, is in the credit for the reporting of the figures related to the transports to Auschwitz. Vrba, in his 1961 affidavit (which did not mention Wetzler), and also in his Frankfurt testimony, presented himself as being primarily responsible for the figures. The WRB report, on the other hand, while it attributes the figures to both men, present the figures in the first section of the report, whose author is supposed to be Wetzler.
		</p>
		<p>
			Vrba does not explain, in his 1964 book, why he waited 16 years to talk about his escape from Auschwitz, and his delivery of the statistics which were eventually published by Washington. His book follows, roughly, the story of the WRB report, with a few contradictions of varying degrees of importance. For example in the book (p. 128) Vrba writes that the girls working in the &quot;Canada&quot; area were in very good health, but in the WRB report (pt. I, p. 31) these women were &quot;beaten and brutalized and their mortality was much higher than among the men.&quot; Other oddities in his book are his claim to have helped build the crematoria (p. 16, not mentioned in the WRB report), and his description of an Allied air raid on April 9, 1944, of which there is no record (p. 233; he says that he and Wetzler hid in a woodpile for three days at Auschwitz after their April 7 escape. The possibility of an Allied air raid in April in discussed in chapter V.). Wetzler just barely manages to get mentioned in Vrba's book. Vrba says nothing about the Polish major or the two Jews who supposedly escaped later on to supplement the Auschwitz transport figures. In the book the other prisoners refer to him as &quot;Rudi,&quot; although his original name, and the name by which he was supposedly known at Auschwitz, is supposed to have been Walter Rosenberg (a point Vrba's book does not bring up but is claimed elsewhere, e.g. in They Fought Back, ed. by Yuri Suhl, and in Fighting Auschwitz, by Jozef Garlinski). Vrba says nothing about resting in a mountain retreat after escaping.
		</p>
		<p>
			Just as conclusive, in our evaluation of Vrba's story, as the various contradictions of either the WRB report or known fact, is the general tone of the book and his description of how various people behaved at the camp. Although the book presents utterly incredible material in this connection from beginning to end, the best example is Vrba's description of an alleged visit by Himmler on July 17, 1942 (pp. 9-15, not mentioned in the WRB report). The prisoners were drawn up for inspection, and the orchestra was in readiness to play when Himmler arrived. As they waited, the leader of the orchestra

				Slowly he marched down the ranks, a little killer aping a big killer, glaring at each of us in turn. If he found dirty finger nails or wooden shoes not properly blacked, he howled abuse at the offender and thumped him with his heavy bamboo cane. He even inspected us, nursery fashion, behind the ears and then went prowling through the barracks, searching for blankets which had not been folded with precision.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Vrba mentions a second Himmler visit (pp. 15-19; the visit seems to correspond to the March 1943 visit of dignitaries from Berlin to witness gassing) in January 1943 to witness the gassing of 3,000 Polish Jews. The event was scheduled for 9 A.M. but Himmler took until 11 A.M. to finish breakfast, so the 3,000 Jews had to wait two hours in the gas chamber. Himmler finally witnessed the gassing in a cheerful and relaxed mood, chatting with the commandant and others, occasionally throwing a glance through the peep-hole to observe the Jews being gassed.
		</p>
		<p>
			The book manages to maintain this utterly incredible tone throughout, as you can verify by reading it, if you can stand it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Reitlinger does not cite Vrba's book in any connection in the second edition of his book. He writes of Vrba as the author of the &quot;most important&quot; part of the WRB report, the first section, although the data offered shows that this role should be attributed to Wetzler. It does not appear important or relevant to Reitlinger that Vrba was only 18-years-old when, he claims, he started collecting the numerical and other data concerning the transports to Auschwitz, with the intention of making this information available to the outside world.
		</p>
		<p>
			There has been no claimed break, so far as I know, in the anonymity of the Polish major. Erich Kulka, of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, in an article in Suhl's book, offers names for the two authors of the supplementary section (Czezln Mordowicz who changed h is name to Petr Podulka, and Arnost Rosin who changed his name to Jan Rohac), but I know nothing of these people other than that they remained quiet about their heroic exploits for an even greater number of years than Vrba and Wetzler did. Moreover neither Elias, nor Soos, nor Vrba (as Vrba or as Rosenberg), nor Weissmandel appeared as witnesses in any of the Nuremberg trials, despite the sometimes contested role played by document 011-L at those trials.
		</p>
		<p>
			The records of the International Tracing Service in Arolsen, West Germany, report that two Jews named Wetzler and Rosenberg did escape on April 7, 1944, and this agrees with the &quot;Kalendarium&quot; published by the Polish government in 1964 as no. 7 of Hefte von Auschwitz, which also declares that two Jews named Mordowicz and Rosin escaped on May 27, 1944. Since there were many successful escapes from Auschwitz during this period (many, many more than Vrba seems to think there were &mdash; compare p. 217 of Vrba with Garlinski's remarks about escapes), this data may well be correct, but it still does not authenticate the authorship of the WRB Report, especially since we are told today that after escaping the four Jews adopted aliases for concealment purposes and that three of the four retained these different names after the war rather than reassume their real names.
		</p>
		<p>
			The details behind the manufacture of the WRB report will probably never be completely uncovered, but it is entirely possible that its creators went to great lengths in simulating a report miraculously smuggled to Slovakia and then to Switzerland. If it was written in Slovakia then is seems clear that Rabbi Weissmandel should be credited with at least coauthorship. It is also possible that, as claimed, the report was given to the Papal Charge d'affaires in Slovakia, Guiseppe Burzio, and that it was forwarded by him to Rome. It is clear that Burzio was contacted by Jewish propagandists and that he forwarded at least some of their &quot;information&quot; to Rome. Examples which Burzio transmitted to the Vatican were March 22 claims that the Germans were taking young Jewish women from their families to make them prostitutes for German soldiers on the eastern front (a complete fantasy) and an early 1943 letter from a Bratislava priest claiming that both Jewish and responsible German sources had told him of the soap factories supplied with the bodies of gassed and machine-gunned Jews. Whether Burzio forwarded such material purely as routine procedure or because he gave credence to it is hardly relevant, although the latter appears to be the case. The Vatican received and filed many such reports during the war, but never gave any credence to them. Its present positions is that, during the war, neither it nor the &quot;Jewish agencies were aware that the deportations were part of a general mass annihilation operation&quot; (see also Appendix E). / 51
		</p>
		<p>
			In any case it is obvious that the WRB report is spurious. The data given in the report is not the sort of information that escapees would carry out; the claim that two more Jews escaped later on to supplement this data is more than doubly ridiculous. Instead of coming forward immediately after the war with ostensible authors of the report, in order to lend more support to the lie, it appears that it was assumed that the whole thing was irrelevant until, for some reason (probably Reitlinger's curiosity), an author was produced sixteen years after the event. That person's story is not credible.
