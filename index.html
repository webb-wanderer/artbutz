			Dr. Arthur R. Butz was born and raised in New York City. He received his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1965 he received his doctorate in Control Sciences from the University of Minnesota. In 1966 he joined the faculty of Northwestern University (Evanston, Illinois), where he is now Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. Dr. Butz is the author of numerous technical papers. Since 1980 he has been a member of the Editorial Advisory Committee of <i><a href="https://www.historiography-project.com/jhrchives/index.html">The Journal of Historical Review</a>,</i> published by the Institute for Historical Review.

			Art Butz is in many ways the archetype of the modern Holocaust revisionist. He is intelligent, fearless, observant, fair-minded, and comprehensive in his approach to the subject. In addition, he has a tremendous ability to put each historical fact into the correct context.
		</p>
		<p>
			These qualities can most easily be seen in his book, <i><a href="/book/index.html">The Hoax of the Twentieth Century: The case against the presumed extermination of European Jewry</a>.</i> Butz was the first to examine this topic from a scholarly viewpoint, and his scope is so exhaustive that the only changes to it over the last 30 years have been the additions of a couple appendices. In other words, in the three decades since the introduction of <i>Hoax,</i> there has been no need to make any substantive changes, despite the fact that the book represents a <q>secular heresy</q> to the received wisdom of Holocaust extermination claims.
