	<h2>My conjecture borne out</h2>
	<address> by Arthur R. Butz </address>
	<p>
		In closing Chapter 7 of my 1976 book <i><a href="https://www.unz.com/book/arthur_r_butz__the-hoax-of-the-twentieth-century/">The Hoax of the Twentieth Century</a>,</i> I wrote:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			<b> Himmler Nailed It Perfectly </b>
		</p>
		<p>
			The <q>gas chambers</q> were wartime propaganda fantasies completely comparable to the garbage that was shoveled out by Lord Bryce and associates in World War I. The factual basis for these ridiculous charges was nailed with perfect accuracy by Heinrich Himmler, in an interview with a representative of the World Jewish Congress just a few weeks before the end of the war:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<q>in order to put a stop to the epidemics, we were forced to burn the bodies of incalculable numbers of people who had been destroyed by disease. We were therefore forced to build crematoria, and on this account they are knotting a noose for us.</q>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			It is most unfortunate that Himmler was a <q>suicide</q> while in British captivity because, had he been a defendant at the IMT, his situation would have been such that he would have told the true story (being fully informed and not in a position to shift responsibility to somebody else) and books such as the present book would not be necessary because the major material could be read in the IMT trial transcript. But then, you see, it was not within the bounds of political possibility that Himmler live to talk at the IMT.
		</p>
		<p>
			That Himmlerâ€™s assessment of the gas chamber accusations is the accurate one should be perfectly obvious to anybody who spends any time with this subject, as we have seen especially in Chapter 4. In particular, Hilberg and Reitlinger should have been able to see this before completing even fractions of their thick books, which are monumental foolishness.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Heinrich Himmler was of course the head of the SS, in effect a national chief of police, security and intelligence, outranked only by Hitler. The <q>IMT</q> was the first Nuremberg trial, the International Military Tribunal. No other Nazi's testimony would have been of greater postwar interest than his.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, 60 years after the event, David Irving and associates have <a href="http://www.fpp.co.uk/Himmler/death/PRO_docs_story.html">found and posted documents</a> which show that Himmler was indeed murdered by orders of the British government after his capture in May 1945, in order to make it impossible for him <q>to take the stand in any prospective prosecution, or &hellip; be interrogated by the Americans.</q>
	</p>
	<p>
		On May 24 the deed was reported done and on May 27 there was an order to <q>maintain a complete news blackout</q> on the murder as exposure <q>would have devastating repercussions for this country's standing.</q>
	</p>
	<p>
		Irving remarks that Himmler was a man <q>for whose proper public trial and punishment the blood of millions of his victims cried out,</q> but I do not know what he is talking about.
