			Butz and &lsquo;Pop the Top&rsquo;
		</h2>
		<address> by <a href="/index.html">Arthur R. Butz</a> </address>
		<p>
			On 1 May 1997 I read, in the <i>Chicago Tribune,</i> of a strange project in a junior high school in the small town of Mahomet, Illinois. A social studies teacher had given his students the task of collecting 6 million tabs from the tops of soda pop cans, in order to get <q>children to fully conceive of how many Jews died in Nazi concentration camps during World War II.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			On account of national publicity given the project many donations of soda pop can tabs were received. As of 1 May the project goal had been exceeded by 1.5 million, so the project was redefined to aim for the collection of 12 million, the change being <q>to represent the estimated additional 6 million Poles, homosexuals, political prisoners and others who died at the hands of the Nazis.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			Some contributors of tabs admonished students <q>to beware of those who would deny the Holocaust.</q> Indeed according to the newsletter <i>ADL on the Frontline</i> (Summer 1997), the ADL (Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, a major national Jewish organization) became one of the contributors to the <q>Pop the Top</q> project, <q>because (they) felt it was particularly timely after Arthur Butz, a Northwestern University professor, used the college&rsquo;s computer server to promote his Holocaust-denial propaganda on the World Wide Web</q>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The reader is therefore advised that a consequence of studying the materials at this site may be an urging from some quarters to atone by contributing soda pop can tabs. Those of legal age may <q>Pop the Top</q> on a beer instead.
