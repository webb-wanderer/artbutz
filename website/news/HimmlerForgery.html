	<h2>Documents on Himmler murder forged</h2>
	<address> by <a href="/index.html">Arthur R. Butz</a> </address>
	<p>
		Three weeks ago <a href="HimmlerMurder.html">I reported</a> that David Irving had posted documents proving that Heinrich Himmler was murdered. Now, as a result of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/07/02/nhimmler02.xml">investigations</a> commissioned by the London newspaper <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, it appears these documents were forged.
	</p>
	<p>
		The documents in question came from the archives of the British <q>Public Records Office</q>, loosely referred to as the <q>National Archives</q>. The institution in question does indeed correspond to the U.S. National Archives, and a determination that documents found in either institution are phonies was viewed as highly unlikely to impossible.
	</p>
	<p>
		The identity of the persons who planted the forged documents, and the date of the deed, are not known at present.
	</p>
	<p>
		At present (2 July 2005) David Irving <a href="https://www.fpp.co.uk/online/05/06/Himmler_DTel_020705.html">seems not convinced</a> forgery has been proved, though Martin Allen, author of the book that started this controversy, <i>Himmler&rsquo;s Secret War</i>, published in May, concedes the forgery. I am willing to entertain another surprise, but at present I accept that the documents are forgeries.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I reported on these documents here I had no doubt as to their authenticity, just as I would not doubt documents from the U.S. National Archives. However I had one nagging concern. Why would the perpetrators consign their crime to formal government documents? My question reflected astonishment rather than skepticism.
	</p>
	<p>
		Meanwhile, my conjecture that Himmler was murdered still stands.
